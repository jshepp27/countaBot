Tremendous progress has been made in recent years to secure the rhino\u2019s habitat but so much more needs to be done considering this species may very well disappear in the next 10 years,\" said President and CEO of the World Wildlife Fund in a press release, Carter Roberts.\nIn the video, the rhino comes out of the jungle brush and then proceeds to sniff the camera and equipment surrounding it. The video also shows the rhino getting a bite to eat.\nIt is estimated that there are only 25 to 50 of the rhinos alive on the planet, and they can only be found in the jungles of Sabah, or better known as the \"Heart of Borneo.\" For the past 20 years, the rhino has not been reported anywhere else in Sabah and researchers say that it is likely \"extinct\" in the rest of Malaysia.\nResearchers say that poaching to use the rhino's horn in medicine and encroachment into their habitats are causing them to decline. Researchers also say that because the rhino is so isolated from the rest of Malaysia, that they are rarely able to breed together.\n\"The rhino is very sensitive to the presence of human beings. Till now, we can still see the rhino, but if we cannot develop any kind of protection method, I think the rhinos will survive less than 10 years,\" said a project manager for the WWF for elephants and rhinos in the Borneo region, Raymond Alfred.\nIn 2006, the first ever still image was captured of the rhino."}

The core of the matter revolves around the implementation of the Islamic dress code; additionally, heavy-handed measures should be shunned.

They don't understand that use of force only brings hatred towards them, not love.\" Nevertheless, , Iran's interior minister who is in charge of policing, prognosticated positive feedback from the populace when he said, \"People are unhappy with the social and moral status of the society. They expect that the fight against social insecurity be properly implemented.\" Thus, Hujjat al-Islam Pour-Mohammadi re-iterated the necessity of proper implementation and methodology towards the restoration of morality in the Islamic Republic.

He also discussed economic issues and internal affairs, and made it clear that next year's address would be given by another President.\nPutin began his 72-minute long state-of-nation address by requesting one minute of silence for Boris Yeltsin, who died at age 76 last Monday of a heart condition. He suggested that a national library be established in the name of the deceased president. Putin's speech had originally been scheduled for Wednesday, but it was postponed one day because of the funeral for Putin's predecessor. Putin followed Yeltsin as Acting President when the latter unexpectedly resigned on December 31, 1999. Putin was then elected May 7, 2000.\nForeign policy.\nPutin attacked unnamed foreign political influences in Russia's politics: \"There is a growing influx of foreign cash into the country used for the sole purpose of meddling in our internal affairs,\" Putin declared in the Kremlin, before both the upper and lower houses of Russia's parliament. \"Some people are not averse to using the dirtiest methods, trying to foment interethnic and religious hatred in our multi-ethnic country. That is why I call on you to speed up the adoption of amendments to legislation toughening punishment for extremist actions,\" the president said.\nThis month, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia complained about U.S. funding to organisations promoting democracy. Putin continued: \"There are those who, skilfully using pseudo-democratic rhetoric, would like to return to the recent past \u2014 some to loot the country's national riches, to rob the people and the state; others to strip us of economic and political independence.\"\nThe head of state urged the lawmakers he addressed to give up the 1990 Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty. He explained how NATO countries that signed the treaty did not respect its clauses, which limit conventional military forces in Europe.\nPutin: \"NATO countries are planning to station elements of anti-missile defence systems in Poland and the Czech Republic, and new member countries like Slovakia and Baltic states, despite the agreements with the Alliance, have not yet joined the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty. This poses a real danger for us with unpredictable outcomes. Therefore I think it is necessary to declare a moratorium on Russia's implementation of this treaty.\" He thinks the moratorium should be upheld \"until all countries of the world have ratified and started to strictly implement it\".\nKremlin aides stressed however that freezing Russia's efforts to comply with the treaty were not directly linked to the U.S. plans for a weapons shield in Eastern Europe. Prior to the NATO-Russia council meeting in Oslo, Norway today, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice dismissed the idea that the shield would pose a strategic threat to Russia, calling the Russian concerns \"purely ludicrous\".\nDomestic issues.\nPutin acknowledged that political analysts were expecting him to endorse a candidate as his successor, but instead he said: \"It is premature for me to declare a political will.\" He made it clear, however, that he would not pursue a third presidency in the elections of next March, by stating that \"The next state-of-the-nation address will be given by another head of state.\" The Russian constitution only permits two terms as president, but last month the head of the Federation Council of Russia, the upper house of parliament, proposed making a third term possible. \nOn the other hand, Putin didn't seem eager to give up his political life completely after the end of his second term. \"It is premature for me to come out with political last wills and testaments,\" the president commented.\nOn the upcoming parliamentary elections next December and ongoing reforms of the voting system, Putin said that a system of proportional representation would \"help the opposition widen its representation,\" and ensure a fair result. The \"Associated Press\", however, reports that a new system based on party-lists is perceived by critics as a way of hindering smaller opposition parties.\nOn foreign influences on Russian culture, Putin said that \"Society can only meet big national challenges when ... it preserves respect for its native language (and) its distinctive cultural values.\"\nThe president praised Russia's economy as one of the top 10 economies in the world. Russia's oil income has soared due to high oil prices on the world market. Putin suggested using some of the money from the auction of bankrupt oil company Yukos to finance housebuilding and transport infrastructure projects. \"It is inadmissible for a country with such reserves accumulated from its oil and gas revenues to be at peace with the fact that millions of its citizens live in Khrushchev-era housing,\" Putin said, referring to the living conditions under Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, who reigned between Joseph Stalin and Leonid Brezhnev.\nAnother idea involved a ship canal between the Caspian Sea and Black Sea. He also thinks it would be a good idea to encourage private pension saving by adding top-up payments to the amount of rubles Russians save for their retirement. For Putin, state pensions should rise by 65% by 2009.\nOn the matter of energy, Putin called for an increase in power generation by two-thirds by 2020. 26 new nuclear power plants could help achieve this goal, the President thinks."}

His craft at the time was 30 miles away from the island and had an elevation of 4,000ft.\nAs Bowyer approached Alderney, he noticed another object identical to the first one.\nBowyer, who has been flying commercial aircrafts for about 20 years, said that he did file a report on the incident and did contact air traffic controllers during the incident.\nPaul Kelly, 31, who was the Jersey Airport air traffic controller on duty during the incident, said that the airport received simultaneous reports from the Aurigny and Blue Island pilot and that the Blue Island pilot had reported a UFO approximately 1,500ft underneath his plane. Kelly noted that the airport was unable to detect the object on their radar.\nJohn Spencer, deputy chairman of the British UFO Research Association, said: \"These types of sightings have been reported by pilots - generally accepted to be reliable and sensible observers - since the 1940s and they have excited attention to this day. Such light effects are often popularly thought to represent alien visitors but many UFO researchers believe they more likely represent natural atmospheric phenomena not yet fully understood by science. However, a similar encounter in 1978 over the Bass Straits in Australia, where the pilot was in radio contact with the ground throughout, resulted in the pilot never being heard from again, so these phenomena are important to study.\" \nNick Pope, who previously worked for the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence, said: \"While no witnesses are infallible, pilots are trained observers and less likely than most people to misidentify something mundane. The MoD's UFO case files contain several reports from civil and military pilots, some of which were correlated by radar. This is the sort of sighting that is taken seriously and should be investigated thoroughly. While most UFOs can be explained as misidentifications of aircraft, weather balloons, satellites and suchlike, a small percentage are more difficult to explain. This is one of the most intriguing sightings I've heard about in recent years.\" \nThe current spokesperson for the UK Ministry of Defence said that they would not be investigating this incident."}

If light conditions were not good enough for play to resume then they would have to wait for the next day to complete the match. Eventually the Sri Lankan captain sent his batsmen back out to play in near-complete darkness, the Australian captain agreeing to only allow spinners to bowl for the safety of the batsmen.\nThe final 3 overs were eventually bowled but nothing really changed: Malinga was stumped and sent on his way by Man of the Match Gilchrist but the balls slowly ran out and Australia stormed home to win the tournament.\nMatch statistics.\nToss: Australia won, and elected to bat first.\nFall of wickets: 1-172 (Hayden, 22.5 ov), 2-224 (Gilchrist, 30.3 ov), 3-261 (Ponting, 35.4 ov), 4-266 (Watson, 36.2 ov)\nDid not bat: Michael Hussey, Brad Hogg, Nathan Bracken, Shaun Tait, Glenn McGrath\nFall of wickets: 1-7 (Tharanga, 2.1 ov), 2-123 (Sangakkara, 19.5 ov), 3-145 (Jayasuriya, 22.6 ov), 4-156 (Jayawardene, 25.5 ov), 5-188 (Dilshan, 29.6 ov), 6-190 (Silva, 30.1 ov), 7-194 (Arnold, 31.5 ov), 8-211 (Malinga, 33.6 ov)\nDid not bat: Muttiah Muralitharan\nAustralia: M L Hayden, A C Gilchrist (wkt), R T Ponting (capt), M J Clarke, A Symonds, M E K Hussey, S R Watson, G B Hogg, N W Bracken, S W Tait, G D McGrath&lt;br&gt;\nSri Lanka: S T Jayasuriya, W U Tharanga, K C Sangakkara (wkt), D P M D Jayawardene (capt), L P C Silva, T M Dilshan, R P Arnold, W P U J C Vaas, C R D Fernando, S L Malinga, M Muralitharan\nPlayer of the match: A C Gilchrist\nPlayer of the Tournament: G D McGrath\nUmpires: Aleem Dar (Pakistan) and S A Bucknor (West Indies)&lt;br&gt;\nTV umpire: R E Koertzen (South Africa)&lt;br&gt;\nMatch referee: J J Crowe (New Zealand)&lt;br&gt;\nReserve umpire: B F Bowden (New Zealand)&lt;br&gt;"}

The cello player only died four days after his friend Boris Yeltsin.\nRostropovich was not only considered to be one of the best cellists in the world, but he also was a symbol of the resistance to the Soviet regime. In 1970, he provided shelter to Alexander Solzhenitsyn, whose writings alerted the world to the Gulag system of forced labour camps in the Soviet Union. Because of his support for dissidents, Rostropovich fell in disgrace and lost his citizenship in 1978. He was restored during the perestroika reforms.\nRostropovich conducted the U.S. National Symphony Orchestra from 1977 to 1994. In February, Russian President Vladimir Putin offered him the First Degree in the Order of Service to the Fatherland for his \"outstanding contribution to the development of world music and many years of creative activity.\"\nPresident Putin, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, French PM Dominique de Villepin and others have already expressed their regrets about the loss of Rostropovich.

If determined to be free of melamine, the ingredients will be released to the intended recipient. Materials such as glutens and protein powders are used commonly in many forms of food products.\nThe CFIA said it was not acting on specific information, but rather taking a cautious approach to human protection. \"That's why we have the border lookout for the ingredient, so that we can proactively assess any potential that the product is contaminated,\" Paul Mayers of the CFIA told \"CBC News\".\nSince the border alert for melamine is a new procedure, the government can't be sure if the contaminant made it into the food chain previously. The CFIA acknowledged that the same Chinese company under suspicion in the tainted pet food affair had shipped wheat gluten to a Canadian company, which in turn used it in food for fish farms. Although the fish were subsequently eaten by people, the CFIA believes the health risk from such consumption would be low.\nIn related news, Canadian researchers at the University of Guelph believe they may have determined the mechanism of how melamine caused illness in cats and dogs.\nBoth cyanuric acid and melamine were found in urine samples from pets that died after consuming contaminated pet food. The two compounds react with one another to form crystals that may block kidney function, researchers at the university said. The researchers observed crystals formed in cat urine by the addition of melamine and cyanuric acid. The composition of these crystals matches those found in the urine of affected pets when compared by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).\n\"You wouldn't normally expect to find those compounds in pet food, and hence nobody was really looking for it,\" said John Melichercik, director of analytical laboratory services. \"It's just another piece of the puzzle along the way in this particular pet-food issue.\""}

The fire resulted in the collapse of at least two sections of bridges at the interchange, including one carrying I-580. The multi-level freeway interchange known as the MacArthur Maze connects the Bay Bridge (Interstate 80) to Interstates 580, 880, and 980 and California State Highway 24, and as such it connects several major cities in California, including San Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley.\nThe driver, James Mosqueda, 51, of Woodland, California, escaped from his truck before the fire. He was the only person reported to be hurt, suffering second-degree burns. No other vehicles were involved in the crash.\nThe driver was believed to be speeding, resulting in a loss of control of the truck, causing it to flip over and subsequently burst into flames. As the truck was traveling on the interchange of I-80 eastbound to I-880 southbound near the San Francisco Bay Bridge, it is speculated to have hit a guard rail or column during a turn. Shortly thereafter, it exploded into a fire that lasted several hours.\nCaltrans officials have announced that repairs will be fast-tracked, but will still take several weeks. Public transit has responded with plans to increase service and re-route buses that used the destroyed interchange.\nGov. Schwarzenegger has declared a state of emergency that in addition to expediting repairs will suspend restrictions on truck traffic hours and provide free use of area public transportation on Monday, April 30."}

While security forces estimated the number of demonstrators at 700 000, estimates around 1 million and more are reported in the Turkish media.\nThe scene of the previous \"Protect your Republic\" demonstration in Turkey's capital Ankara was repeated, with uncountable Turkish flags and many posters of Atat\u00fcrk, founder of the modern Turkish state. The protesters shouted slogans like: \"Turkey is secular and will remain secular!\".\nThe demonstrators fear that current Foreign Minister Abdullah G\u00fcl, the presidential candidate of the ruling AK Party of Prime Minister Erdo\u011fan, will allow Islamic influences in Turkey to become more powerful. The party officially denies having such a hidden agenda.\nThe army, traditionally loyal to the Turkish pro-secular side, accused the government on Friday of tolerating radical Islam. But G\u00fcl replied: \"It is out of the question to withdraw my candidacy.\" In 1997 the democratically elected Islamic-oriented President Necmettin Erbakan was removed from office by the army, with public support.\nIn Turkey, the president is elected directly by the parliament, and G\u00fcl failed to get elected in the first round of the elections, when opposition lawmakers boycotted the vote. The opposition also appealed to the Constitutional Court to declare the process unlawful. A second round is to be held on Wednesday, and a third one on May 9.\nG\u00fcl's wife Hayrunisa wears a head scarf and has appealed to the European Court of Human Rights to be allowed to wear it at a university. But secular Turks want to keep the current ban on wearing such scarves in public places.\nReactions.\nPrime Minister Erdo\u011fan in a national television address on Monday called for national unity: \"Unity, togetherness, solidarity, these are the things we need most. We can overcome many problems so long as we treat each other with love.\"\n\"Even four and a half years ago, this country was riven by serious problems, which thank goodness have been overcome one by one,\" the Prime Minister said, referring to the many reforms his government has implemented since it came into power. He also pointed out Turkey's steady growth rate during the last years. To maintain this, he asked the nation for stability: \"At this point, it's enough that we protect the environment of stability, it's enough that we protect the environment of peace. Enough that we don't harm the environment of confidence we have worked so hard to attain.\"\nIn reaction to the ongoing uncertainty, the E.U. enlargement commissioner warned the Turkish Army about interfering: \u201cIt is important that the military leaves the remit of democracy to the democratically-elected government and this is the test case if the Turkish armed forces respect democratic secularism and the democratic arrangement of civil-military relations,\u201d commissioner Olli Rehn said. Erdo\u011fan and G\u00fcl support Turkey's efforts to join the European Union.\nThe Turkish stock market lost 4,01 per cent on Monday, which analysts attribute to the current political crisis."}

To win he needed 634 votes. He received 690.\nThis is his first attempt at running for politics. His father was Prime Minister of Canada from the 1960s until the mid-1980s.\nHis two other competitors for the nomination were natives from the town; Mary Deros, a city councillor and Basilio Giordano, a former city councillor and journalist for a local Italian newspaper. Competitors for the other federal party's have not yet been chosen. According to reports Deros received 350 votes and Basilio Giordano received 220.\nTrudeau will run in the 40th Canadian federal election, which must be called no later than February 13, 2011.\n\"I'm a teacher; I'm a convenor; I'm a gatherer; I'm someone who reaches out to people and is deeply interested in what they have to say,\" Trudeau said. \"And people see that I'm not faking it. I'm actually genuinely committed to this dialogue that we're opening up, and this understanding that needs to happen in order to be an effective MP.\"\nTrudeau does not live in Papineau. It is the poorest riding in Canada and the smallest. It consists of blue-collar residents.\nThe riding has a long history of Liberal MPs. In the 1949 federal election an Independent MP held the riding. Liberal Adrien Meunier was re-elected three times holding the riding from 1949 to 1962. Liberal Guy Favreau was re-elected once holding the riding from 1963 to 1965. Liberal Andr\u00e9 Ouellet was re-elected six times holding the riding from 1967 to 1984. Liberal Pierre Pettigrew was elected in 2004, he came in second to current Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois MP Vivian Barbot, who won by 17,775 votes.\nTrudeau, 35, is the second child born to a Prime Minister during his term in office to Canada's first, Sir John A. Macdonald, who had a his daughter Margaret Mary Macdonald during his time in office. He has a Bachelor of Arts of English literature from Montreal's McGill University and the Bachelor of Education from the University of British Columbia. He eventually became a teacher there.\nHe married French-Canadian television personality Sophie Gr\u00e9goire on March 18, 2005. In April this year they announced they are expecting their first child. Since his youngest sibling Michel Trudeau died in an avalanche in 1998, Trudeau has been an active campaigner for winter sports safety. His younger brother Alexandre Trudeau is a journalist.\nHis father died on 28 September 2000 at the age of 80. During the state funeral, Trudeau, then 28, delivered an emotional speech which led to speculation in the media that a career in politics could be his future. He has also openly stated that he opposes Quebec nationalism. Trudeau put his support behind Liberal leadership candidate Gerard Kennedy during the 2006 Liberal Party of Canada leadership convention. Kennedy dropped out of the second ballot of voting and both he and Trudeau went on to support now leader St\u00e9phane Dion."}

The deal is reported to be worth CAD2.2 billion in an all-cash transaction.\nNAOSC is an Alberta-based oil company founded in 2001. It manages 1,110 square kilometres of oil sands leases located in northern Alberta. It is estimated that the NOASC oil sands hold approximately 2.2 billion barrels of oil reserves. The company is planning to develop an extraction project and an upgrading facility. When the project is completed, NAOSC expects it to produce over 200,000 barrels of bitumen per day. The upgrading facility would then process the bitumen into synthetic crude oil.\nThe NAOSC board of directors has approved the bid from Statoil unanimously, and has recommended that its shareholders accept the offer. One of the largest shareholders of NAOSC currently is Paramount Resources Ltd. (TSX:POU). Paramount announced Friday that it had entered into a lock-up agreement with Statoil, which calls for Paramount to sell its 30.9% interest in NAOSC to Statoil ASA for a cash deal worth approximately $682 million.\n\"We are impressed by the performance and competence held by the employees in NAOSC,\u201d said Helge Lund, chief executive of Statoil. \u201cCombined with Statoil\u2019s experience and commitment to prudent operations, we are well-positioned to develop the resources in a sustainable manner, creating value for Statoil and its shareholders.\"\nStatoil suggests that the development plans for the NAOSC oil sands includes an application of Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) technology, which, according to the company, leaves a smaller environmental footprint than strip mining. Statoil admits, however, that heavy oil production, such as is required in the oil sands, is \"energy intensive and challenging in an environmental perspective.\" The company said it intends to capture the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from its oil sands production and store it underground.\nUnder new environmental regulations announced Thursday by Canadian Environment Minister John Baird, companies that can't meet new intensity targets for CO2 emission reductions will be able to purchase offset credits or contribute to a technology fund, at an initial cost of $15 per tonne of emissions. New plants would have three years before they were obligated to begin reducing their emissions.\nHowever, Julia Langer, director of the World Wildlife Fund's global threats program, told the \"Globe and Mail\" that the initial exemptions for new plants and the technology fund contributions would undermine the government's new environmental plan. \"This is a regulatory plan that is geared to business as usual for the tar sands sector,\" said Langer.\nThe Statoil-NAOSC transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2007."}

Farmers had usually opposed a change to the daylight saving period because it hampered with operations.\nHelen Clark, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, stated that she personally did not support a change to the start of daylight saving in March. However the main reason that the start was altered was to avoid clashes with the fourth school term.\nRick Barker says that they will be working with various companies in the information technology sector to make sure computers are updated and ready for the first new daylight saving period change since 1990.\nThe Department of Internal Affairs will monitor the amount of energy has been saved because of the longer amount of daylight, and the effects it has on the economy.\nIn a press release, Mr Barker said, \"The decision means people will have an extra hour of daylight in the evenings from late September to early April to enjoy the outdoors.

(Dell) announced Tuesday that, due to public demand, they will be offering an alternative to Microsoft Windows on a selection of their desktop and laptop computers. Dell will partner with Canonical Ltd. to pre-install the recently released Ubuntu 7.04 distribution of the Linux operating system.\nUntil recently, Linux distributions have not been adopted by mainstream computer makers due to concerns over ease-of-use. Newer distributions, such as Ubuntu 7.04, have become much more user-friendly, with features such as automatic updates and software installation.\nUbuntu director of business development Chris Kenyon told the \"BBC\" that one of the reasons Ubuntu was selected was its support features and hardware compatibility. \"Dell are going to work with us to make sure Ubuntu works fully on its hardware,\" said Kenyon. A Dell representative suggested that the Ubuntu distribution was chosen due to public demand as expressed on a Dell-run forum website, \"IdeaStorm\". \"It was overwhelming, the response we got to the survey,\" said Jeremy Bolen, a Dell spokesman. \nTuesday's announcement was not the first for Dell's Linux offerings. They have offered servers and workstations with an optional enterprise version of Red Hat Linux for some time now. The chairman and CEO of Dell, Michael Dell, is reported to have Ubuntu installed on his own laptop. \nPerry Donham, an analyst with Aberdeen Group of Boston, suggested that the Dell-Ubuntu partnership will benefit Ubuntu more than it will Dell. \"It's going to be a small part of [Dell's] market,\" said Donham. \"But it's a great win for Ubuntu and for Linux in general.\"\nDell indicated that the Ubuntu-based computers would be available in the next few weeks, from Dell USA only for the time being. The pricing structure has not been revealed, or when such computers would be available in countries other than the United States."}

{"id": "67846", "revid": "39076", "url": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=67846", "title": "Taliban resurgent in Pakistan on enforcement of Sharia law/Interview archive", "text": "What is the current situation in the NWFP?\nThe Pashtun people are or were renowned for their hospitality. Many westerners commented on it. Some with suspicion NOT willing to believe some people so poor could be so generous. It was almost a character flaw. One could travel with out fear of personal danger as long as you followed local protocols. (I would urge you to read Kiplings \"East is East &amp; West is West.\" one more time, know this time that it is written about the Pashtun people.) \nThat was the sort of mind set among the people. An ageless paradigm of self satisfaction: This is enshrined in the code of the Pashtuns way of life (see James Spain \"The Way of the Pathans\") - called Pashtunwali- in Pashto hospitality is referred to as \"maelmastiya\".\nThe Islamic radicalism is in reality nothing but the Taliban movement. As I said earlier not all Pashtuns are Taliban (obviously) but most Taliban are Pashtun. Of these most belong to the FATA. Of these, most were affected by their cousins from Afghanistan coming over. Mingled with them were Arab-Afghans. Uzbeks and some Tajiks and even Chechens. Some of these married within the tribes and formed a bond with the locals. Marriage bonds go back in history. Again remember the mindset of the people here. Always keep that in mind. To them the scripture in the written word of God, and that includes the Old Testament (called Torat (Torah) and (Injeel = Bible less St. Pauls contributions). \nThis Talibanization shows itself in the content of the Friday sermons at the mosque. Now it shows in the popularity of growing beards, especially since the MMA - the coalition of religious political party's - won power. More recently in their showdown with the Pakistan army in N and S Waziristan - where according to my sources, people prefer going to the Taliban for justice rather than the older system of Maliks and Political Agents. The latter are known as corrupt. In Pakistan in general people are sick of the amount of corruption. \nAnd now in Bannu, from where hails the Chief Minister of the NWFP, Mr Durrani, is in Taliban control in the sense that there is a parallel government that they have established and which is functioning quite well and is popular among the people.\nJustice in tribal areas of Pakistan has been handled by elders, following a mixture of tribal tradition and Islamic law. Would you say that Taliban influence has caused a stricter intrepretation of Islamic law in the NWFP?\nYes. The Maliks, or tribal elders who consider themselves quite conservatively religious, even so had a laid back attitude towards enforcement of religious doctrine. That is where the difference comes. My opinion is that this is the reason that the Maliks supported the government of Pakistan in South Waziristan, which has recently been in the news having kicked out the militant Uzbek who came as guests in the post-soviet era and started mischief of their own but am not sure what their agenda was to begin with, and I myself have questions about their presence as to why they were not reported earlier, since reporting the presence of any foreigner(s) in the FATA is job one of the Pakistani Political Agents (PA). Why is the presence of the Uzbeks and the Chechen in the area just coming to light? Remember there are seven of these PA's - one for each FATA. The Taliban emulated the Saudi system of having a department concerned with citizens\u2019 morals, even the name is the same, the department for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, and this department has \u2013 as in Saudi Arabia, an enforcement police, called mutawwa'in, a morals law-enforcement agency. \nHas there been a shift from tribal elders to clerics, as the main interpreters of law?\nYes there has been a movement in that direction but it has started a power struggle between the clerics who traditionally have been at the lowest strata of the social structure, to now when they have seen a bigger role for themselves first from the Taliban in Afghanistan \u2013 but also the government of the MMA in the NWFP who are nothing more than glorified clerics themselves, only a little smarter in exploiting religion politically, and the MMA is largely non-Pashtun which is a source of discontent in that they stand in the way of Pashtun nationalism, such as it is, because it only rears its head when non-Pashtuns start to usurp power over what the Pashtun consider their turf.\nThe deal made between Pakistani central government and the North and South Waziristan provinces, where tribal leadership was given the pivotal role in dealing with militants and the Taliban, has been criticized as a failure. What caused an initiative by tribal authority to fail? \nFirst off, I don't agree with the premise of the question, that the \"deal\" is a \"failure\" - for the following reasons: \nIf the Talibanization of Pakistan is partly due to a perception of corruption among the older system of Maliks and Political Agents, and Musharraf has critics lining up, who can the U.S. turn to in dispensing with $10 billion in aid monies? \nTalibanization has nothing to do with your premise there. Zilch. Nada. The corruption is in the ISI, the Pak army and the Pak system of Political Agents (PA) assigned to these tribal zones (FATA &amp; PATA). These PA have budgets that are much like the CIA in that they are a single line item in the national budget, there is no accountability of where or how the PA spends the money. If one followed the IRS rules and looked at the lifestyles of the PA and compared them with their income, you would soon understand what was going on. Musharraf critics are a larger issue. For eons, Republicans have coddled Pakistan with the belief that \"as long as they are pro America\" - democracy in Pakistan will come in due course. Democrats have, I think, insisted Democracy first, and then we can discuss the other issues later. For example, pre 9/11, compare how Carter's administration treated Gen Zia and how Reagan's administration treated him. \nThe Talibanization of Pakistan has more to do with graduates of \"Raiwind\" a place near Lahore where the \"Tablighi Jamaat\" conducts brainwashing camps. It was graduates of this place, in my opinion, that are responsible for Britain's 7/7 attacks as an example. For the Talibanization of the FATA, see Ahmed Rashid's classic study on the subject wrt to Afghanistan but applicable to Pashtuns in the NWFP equally, in a sense.\nCorruption amongst the Maliks is self limiting because of the egalitarian society they live &amp; because of Pashtunwali (see Charles Lindholm, Oxford press). \nWho can the US turn to? This is a tough one. The Pakistani national psyche has not progressed the way the Indians have. There are still very much remnants of the Raj visible and present and invisible but Pakistani behavior gives it away - in the way they treat household help, in the way company bosses treat their employees, in the way the government officers often act above the law. For example the NWFP is supposed to be dry - yet the governemt employees consume copious amounts of liquor. There are some that even moonshine at home. (I have pictures I could share taken at \"dance\" party, more like a stag party.)\nI think this last question is best answered in who has been reliable in the past, and assume the past to be an indicator of future behavior.\nWe know the Pak army will siphon large amounts towards its Nuclear program and the upkeep of its generals.\nWe know that Nawaz Sharif left the national treasury almost bankrupt when Musharraf took over.\nWe know that Benazir husband took 10% of all government deals. I believe he has an Interpol warrant for his arrest, although I can't vouch for it, it does come out in the news, even though it's puzzling why Interpol has trouble executing the warrant. Now I hear they are withdrawn. \nSo who does that leave? \nThe next generation of Politicians who are not beholden to anyone. \nIn my opinion, the US should insist on the scheduled elections but accede to some genuine Pakistani concerns: \nNawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto ought to be ineligible to run, BUT other members of the respective party PML (N) and PPP (B) can do so.\nProhibit allocation of emblems to the religious party which they can &amp; have misused. \nFor example in the last election they asked for and got the symbol of a book, they then went on to advertise the symbol represented the Qur'an and a vote for the book was a vote for the Qur'an - not the candidate but the Qur'an. Well the ploy worked only too well. Imagine a similar vote here where a vote is asked for as a vote for the Bible! You can imagine the results. \nWhat is your take on the Musharraf suspending the judge Iftikhar Chaudhry? \nMy take:\nI believe, and this is widely held belief, that Musharraf has no constituency of his own for his power base. He wanted legitimization from the Supreme Court, and from Mr Choudhry as Chief Justice (their system is not like ours) would not give it. \nSo Musharraf has had to hang on to his Army Chief of Staff position to get his power from the Army. If some one else were Chief of Staff, that person could refuse to support Musharraf.\nThe Justice favorable to the general is Justice Iqbal, who was not the next in line for Chief Justice. The next in line is a Hindu. That presented problems of its own for Musharraf. So when the Hindu judge went for a trip to India, Iqbal became the \"available\" senior most Supreme Court judge, and hence the haste and lack of decorum with which Justice Chaudhry was removed.\nNow we have to wait for the other shoe to fall --- will Iqbal issue a Judicial ruling which would make it easy for Musharraf to stay on as Chief of Staff - in the meantime, the US has asked him to relinquish this army position.\nNeedless to say, it was very badly handled, high handed, and the TV was present -- the country saw what was being done to the highest member of the court of law, and in their mind, as in mine, the law in Pakistan was being manhandled, handcuffed and sent off packing to jail, so to speak. Something we long suspected, but was confirmed on TV and in the Newspapers. Overseas organizations taking up Chaudhry's cause, might lead one to belive that Musharraf's days are numbered, and they would be wrong, because America needs Musharraf - for the time being, anyway - because Iraq has scared America, just as in the post Vietnam era, there is now a fear regarding Muslim countries - the fear of the alternative, will democracy in Muslim country give us more of Ahmedinejad or Al-Maliki, or can we find some Hamid Karzais'? We just don't know.\nCan you tell us what the prevailing sentiment in the region regarding the Pakistani government effort in the provinces and the international effort in Afghanistan to combat Taliban and affiliated militants? \nIn my dealings and inquires, \"one\" thing stood out like a sore thumb - the conspiracy theories vis-\u00e0-vis anything having to do with America. I mentioned to one of my close friends that events that were previously ascribed as acts of God were now considered acts of the CIA. Some even believed that the Earthquake in the northern areas was because of some sort of underground secret \"bomb\" used by the CIA. Lack of evidence is further proof that the CIA did it. I was flabbergasted, and started to give this kind of thinking as an example in speaking to \"educated\" Pakistani's - and among these, those that did agree that the earthquake was NOT the work of the CIA, they would start giving other examples, notably the Blow up of the plane carrying Zia ul Haq an ex President of Pakistan, in which the US Ambassador also perished. When I would point this out, the response would be that that is the sort of thing they do to take away suspicion from themselves.\nIn a nutshell, the impression I came away with is, there is NO war of civilizations going on, what is going on is a war between literacy and illiteracy. I use the latter term in the widest connotation.\nPakistan government efforts: While on the one hand people would decry that the government is not doing enough, in the same breath they would state the government is a puppet of the US and only does what the US tells it to do. In this sense there is very little awareness among the people about what the Pakistani army is doing in the FATA or for that matter in Balochistan. The local newspapers are censored, and if not censored they do not allocate much space to the topics. \"Dawn,\" which is the highest circulation English language paper, carries more stories about the US than about the local stories, that might appear say in \"Newsweek.\" \nThe international effort in Afghanistan is not considered international at all, only American. You could speak till you are blue in the face, and you would not change anyone's mind. In my case they would simply turn quiet, not wishing to offend a \"guest\" (see Pashtunwali). \nIt is commonly agreed that some thing has to be done to curb the religious extremism that has taken root here, while historically these people (Pashtun) are a moderate people (see Olaf Caroe \"The Pathans\"). In fact some of the reasons the extremism has crept in is that many of the cultural practices were not in accordance with Saudi based \"Salafiism\" more popularly known as Wahabism. But Mr Wahab dates to the period of Lawrence of Arabia - Salafism dates further back, and is one of the six or seven schools of \"Fiqh\" or jurisprudence, but the latter fiqh has morphed into a cult like sect. \nTaliban are not visible in the areas I visited, but the militants handiwork clearly is - as elsewhere, the common criminals are taking advantage of this situation, and crime is up significantly. One new crime is Cell phone \"snatching\" - it's easy and nobody wants to pursue it. If some one is using a Razr phone, he can expect to be hit soon, if he uses it in public. So people have two cell phone (Called mobiles here) one fancy to show off, one for use in public places. \nIn so far as \"foreign\" militants are captured and identified, that is to say non-Pashtun (including non Afghan Pashtun or Pak Pashtun) - then the people are obviously in agreement with the government that these people don't belong here and need to go. \nThe problem is this: \nThe foreigners are usually in the FATA and have been there since the Soviet war times. Many of them have taken local wives and now have a family. The local have accepted them into their family. Now for the Pak govt to ask them to kick them out, the locals are thinking what am I doing to my grandchildren's father, etc. Again the edicts of Pashtunwali also play a role.\nWhat kind of support is there in the area for the positions advocated by the Taliban on matters such as Sharia law, women's education, role in public affairs, its proscriptions on entertainment such as movies, music ..etc? \nIn the areas that I visited and the people that I spoke to, which by definition is a very non-random sample, the people are TOTALLY opposed to the Taliban. I do have one nephew who seems to have come under the influence of the Salafi's but that is a different story. I can address that separately and you can decide if it belongs with this story - not my nephew's story but the way the Salafi's have woven themselves into this area --- which is historically a \"Hanafi\" fiqh area, which is much more moderate. Like I said this may be tangential to the main story. \nIn general, people will say Yes we are Muslim and we are for the Sharia, but in general most people do not know what that entails. \nIn their mind it entails a more just system, a less corrupt government. \nBut if you ask them if they want a system like the Taliban the answer is an unequivocal NO. \nWomen's education is quite the norm in the non FATA parts of the NWFP. When I visited the earthquake area which is also mostly in the NWFP, (I have photo's and video) the girl schools were some of the first to spring up. I remember being pleasantly surprised by this at the time. \nAs far as a role in Public, it gets complicated. Women are in general expected to be docile and compliant, and the same expectation foloows through into Public affairs. But this point of view is not limited to the NWFP - it is the same all over Pakistan, excluding the large cities of Lahore, Karachi, Islamabad etc. yet still applicable to Peshawar. \nIn Peshawar you do get to see more girls getting jobs as tellers in a bank and some other non traditional jobs, whereas previously the only jobs were either teachers to young kids, teachers to older girls, nurses and doctors - for the most part. \nMovies in the NWFP in the Theaters are for the lower socio economic men only. The reason is other than Talibanization. The easy availability of pirated, good quality DVD's of Indian and Hollywood movies (From China thru the land route over the Karakorum Highway) - it cost Rs120 ($2/-) for the whole family to watch a movie in the comfort of their home. Travelling to a theater might cost that much in gas. The inconvience. The crowds. The men gawking at the women and last but definitely not least, some bombs exploding in the theater some years back, put a comllete stop to the middle class from going out to see movies. \nPaashtuns love music. So even though I hear that some bus drivers have been fined for playing their cassettes, I doubt this is going to stop them from playing their music. Some thing far worse has to happen - I think the drivers may start carrying guns and having it out with who ever is tring to stop them from their favorite music. \nWhat is not being reported and what the Taliban could do effectively is to cut up cable tv cables. Most cable companies string their cable ABOVE ground to save cost and take it along the electric poles, below the electricity wires. Since these are exposed there have been many (several) instances of the cables being cut up. Luckiliy there is no market for coaxial cable, or more cable would be lost to druggies doing the cutting. The latter is a serious problem that you don't hear about. One person that I knew told me that he was building his house and had poured conrete and reinforcements for the pillars. The next day he found the reinforcement bars to have been cut up flush with the ground slab leaving him to figure out how to do the rebar of the rest of the pillar.\nTo what degree does this support stem from fear and intimidation? \nThe Taliban are Pashtun, and the populace is Pashtun. The Pashtun do not scare easy. They are not intimidated easily. They might comply for the moment and then come back with a vengeance, so to speak. The women folk are more susceptible to intimidation, as was evidenced by the closure of the schools, because the mothers decided that they were not going to take a chance that their kids might get injured.\nHow about the \"political positions\" of the insurgent movement - resistance to foreign troops, and the Karzai government? Is there a separatist or nationalist component to the movement? \nKarzai is not popular among the Pashtun's who are loyal to Pakistan in the NWFP, those are the one I met mostly. They think that Karzai is opportunistic in that he is fleecing the government of the US whereas he himself is little more than the mayor of Kabul. They point to his American bodyguards as proof that he is disliked by his own people, that the moment the American leave Karzai is a dead man. \nI can not speak to the separatist movement. I have seen no evidence of it. There is widespread resentment that the Federal government refuses to give a name to the province, a name of the people's liking - there have been recently articles in Dawn about this, I will try and find them for you.\nNationalism is alive and well on the other hand, all over Pakistan - in all its four provinces. Everybody hates the Punjabi's - almost to the man. \nIt is my opinion that were it not for US aid, Pakistan will go the route of Yugoslavia. With lots of bloodshed. \nResistance to foreign troops is like the national pastime among the Pashtun. Even today they collect in the evenings and will tell tales, vastly glorified of the way their grandfather fought against the British.\nIn other parts of the NWFP, like Charsadda and Mardan where Abdul Ghaffar Khan (the frontier Gandhi) was popular you have old \"khudai khidmatgars\" telling their stories of how they kicked out the British.\nThe only thing that Unites the Pashtun, are foreign troops on their soil. Other than that \"Pashtun Unity\" is almost an oxymoron.\nWhat do you think the U.S., the international community and Pakistan should do to ease the problems in the region?\nIn my opinion, based on my conversations with individuals in positions to know these things, plus a little bit of plain common sense, plus knowing the history of the people and of the area: The ONE thing that will NOT work is direct military action. We know this from history. We know that the Pashtuns love to fight. We know that the Talibanization has brought the Jihadi's into the picture, who like nothing better than to be martyred. So we need to keep this in mind, of what NOT to do. Having said that, what I am going to say next may appear like a paradox. \nBecause the Pashtun do not like to deal with what they believe are wus or weak people, we do need to have a strong PRESENCE there, and a strong \"show of force\" - invite a \"Jirga\" to like a demonstration of what the US air force is capable of doing - just to show them, - the reason is that their paradigm is the 14th century, if you simply told them that we can do this to you, they will simply think you are lying, because that is what they do, they lie to show off. \nBut if you drop a daisy cutter and tell them before hand what it is capable of, or a stealth bomber, these technologies are outsides their mind-set; we have to get them to believe that we have these capabilities, like the Drone. Or spy satellites. \nFrom this position of strength, and always reminding them that we are raring to use our forces in that like them we also love to shoot our guns at every opportunity, but then not actually do it ( in this sense we had achieved all out objectives with Saddam prior to invading Iraq IMHO invading Iraq was redundant) - so the next step would be:\nWhat makes the North-West Frontier Province competent to administer any monies?\nThis is the central question. Much like California has taken a separate initiative on stem cell research \u2013 as an analogy \u2013 the NWFP is central to the war on terror, not Pakistan. \nThe NWFP was central to the fight and aid to the Afghans during the Soviet occupation, not Pakistan. \nThis small distinction is lost on Washington, and it is the main reason, in my opinion, why so much of the Aid was \"lost in transit was because the Punjabi army officers could not bring themselves to dispense such large sums to an ethnic group which it considers anti-Pakistani (You would have to read the history of the Indian partition, in particular that the NWFP was a \u201cIndian Congress Party\u201d controlled province where as the \"Muslim League\" of Jinnah was trying to show the Brits that all the area was FOR the creation of Pakistan). \nAll the FATA is contiguous to the NWFP. The Taliban and Al-Qaeda are holed up somewhere either in the FATA, or across the Durand Line in Afghanistan, the Durand Line has never been recognized by the locals as an international boundary. Even today, the Pashtun travel from Peshawar to Kabul by road with out a passport or visa, and it has been like that for eons.\nThe present governor of the NWFP belongs to the Orakzai tribe (he spells his name Aorakzai) and it is my opinion that that he was picked partly because he belongs to one of the FATA as well as he is a retired General of the Pak Army. \nThe Frontier Constabulary (FC) is a force which primarily recruits from the FATA. All or most of its forces are from the various tribes. In the eyes of the tribes this is a bona fide force and service with the FC is considered an honorable thing. The US has already allocated some funds for increasing recruitment, but far less than what it would take to counter the Taliban and far less than what the economic need is. [The US] spends a thousand times more on a battalions sent to monitor activity over there. Plus why endanger the lives of our troops and spread our forces thin when a more effective job can be done by the FC. The FC has over history shown that they will attack and use force against the tribes that create trouble. There have been no instances of insubordination or mutiny.\nEven the US Embassy is protected by a contingent of the FC! That goes to show their trustworthiness &amp; discipline. \nMy second proposal is that there is a common phenomenon for Pashtun men to go to the Gulf States for jobs.\nThe \"tribal\" Pashtuns ( All Pashtuns are tribal, in that Pashtun form the largest tribal society in the world in terms of numbers) wrt the FATA are not educated or trained and hence not employable right now. I propose that we fund directly the Director of Emigrants (Mr Azhar Arbab) in Islamabad to set up training facilities in Concrete laying, iron work, pipe work, welding etc, which would then qualify these tribesmen to obtain jobs in the Gulf. As such we would remove them from the scene altogether. They would not be available in the labor pool to the Taliban or anyone else. I might add here, that a number of these individuals have very high innate intelligence, which is one reason they make formidable foes. \nNow the central reason why the NWFP ought to do this is because they are themselves most affected by the scourge of Talibanization. They are highly motivated in carrying out these policies because it is to their own benefit. \nOne has to be convinced on this last point, and for that I urge you research the sentiments amongst the people of the province, such as I am willing to provide, and which you can corroborate from other sources as well. \nFor instance, after Malik Saad was murdered, there were people, whom I heard myself, that expressed the feeling (admittedly stunned with grief) \"If this is Islam then fuck such Islam\" (I paraphrase, obviously, the Pashto is not directly translatable) \u2013 moreover, Mr Saad\u2019s posters are competing with Osama\u2019s in the Bazaar\u2019s as a spontaneous gesture from the public. We can\u2019t afford to let this good-will to be lost.\nAn \"Associated Press\" report on \"MSNBC\" dated March 15, 2007 and headlined \"Arrest of al-Qaida\u2019s 'best' reflects changing role\" stated, \"\"A senior Western diplomat in Islamabad, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said the Taliban resurgence had not necessarily led to the re-emergence of al-Qaida training camps in Pakistan - a key U.S. ally in the war on terror - but had \"created the environment for whatever is left of al-Qaida to feel more comfortable.\"\" What does that mean?\nA senior western diplomat usually means a Political Officer in the US Embassy, which most people know is a CIA agent, OR it could be some other Embassy official - \nFirst there is a big difference between Al Qaeda and the Taliban. \nAl Qaeda is mostly composed of Arabs, they do not trust any one else. While they might use others as couriers or in lowly position as servants, for second rate Al Qaeda officials, the Top guys ONLY deal with Arabs and are served by Arabs. \nThe Taliban are mostly Pashtun tribesmen. Mostly they are graduates of madrassa's. \nMostly illiterate by any world standards. The better educated among them will know how to speak a few words of English, such as their Information minister. There might be one or two notable exception of which I am not aware, I had heard Yale had admitted a Taliban, but never followed up on the story. \nHowever while Al Qaeda does not trust the Taliban, the Taliban look up to Al Qaeda top leadership. We saw this situation in Iraq where initially Al Zarqawi had no direct link with Qaeda but was keen to form one. It would be conjecture on my part to state that in the end he did indeed succeed in forming that connection. In the press at least that impression was prevalent.\nSo the lines of interest proceed ONE way, like one way traffic. Extremist want to be affiliated with Qaeda, IMHO, while the latter does not, again, in my opinion want to - so as to maintain its hideout. \nNow we come to the statement below: \nThe Taliban resurgence is not connected directly to the Qaeda.\nThe Qaeda supply lines are hampered, new recruits would have to be Arabs, and they would have to travel a long way through tight Pakistani security to reach here, or suffer hardship over a long and arduous land route through Balochistan and the Tribal area's - NOT all of which are accommodating. \nSo as is becoming clear, Qaeda is having trouble replacing people they loose meaning those that were captured or died. They only trust Arabs, and that also a certain type of Arabs, (not all Arabs are the same, not all Arabic is the same - for example they would never trust a Syrian, in fact Qaeda folks consider Syrian brand of Islam an apostasy - but that is another story). \nOkay so now we can understand the statement, that whatever remains of the Qaeda, are not in a position to set up training camps, since they are in a survival mode. The Taliban resurgence helps them get a little warm and fuzzy in this survival mode, since they feel a little bit more secure with their partners-in-arms doing some evil stuff, blowing up people and causing mayhem.\nHow many men does the FC field currently?\nThe FC currently has about 23000 men in total.\nHow much do they get paid?\nThey are paid the equivalent of $60 per month per person -Pak Rupees 3665, where Rs61= $1. \nThey do have some fringe benefits but life is very spartan for these soldiers.\nWhat the US could get in return is a huge bang for a buck, no pun intended. \nI think we ought to double the number of these soldiers with one proviso that the FC maintains its high standards of recruits.\nCompare this with our costs in the War against Terror; just Halliburton\u2019s bills will have you reeling. I think that it would be foolish, NOT to do this.\nAgain to reinforce the reasons:\nThe Frontier Constabulary is an Institution with a long and glorious history within the Frontier Province.\nThe recruits come strictly from the tribes of the various FATA and so they are very familiar with the people, the bad guys the terrain etc.\nThey speak the Pashto dialect of the locals. The Pashto language has many dialects, and you can tell where someone is from based on which dialect he speaks. So if you do not speak the correct dialect, you are immediately identified as an outsider. This is one reason why these tribes are impossible to penetrate, there are other reasons as well, that are beyond the scope of the current discussion.\nHow can the FC help prevent attacks like the suicide bombing attempt on Sherpao in Charsadda last weekend?\nIn essence your question is how can \"anyone\" prevent a suicide attack? \nAnd frankly if I knew the answer to that I think the US military - and several other groups - would be knocking on my door. I think the Israeli Army has had the most experience with this sort of thing. The suicide bombing as a tactical weapon was invented by the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, and even today in terms of statistics they use it in far greater numbers.\nSo to summarize neither the FC nor anyone else can prevent a suicide bombing. We could attempt to improve our intelligence to find out about an imminent attack, but so far these have not been very successful in Pakistan. \nIn the Lal Masjid Case the government avoided a suicide killing by negotiating with those two Mullah brothers - but I don't know if that counts. But it does make for an interesting story. Both Washington, DC and Islamabad now have Madams threatening to publish the list of their clients unless they are given protection. Who would have thunk?\nGoing back to your question:\nIn my opinion what ought to be done is to make a Policy change, and address the issues that are producing these suicide bombers, that is the only way to stop this phenomenon.\nIn this part of the world this is relatively new because prior to 9/11, suicide bombing was unheard of. Moreover it is not the FC's job to provide security to the Minister of the Interior, that is the job of the Police force, because this Ministry is equivalent to the Department of Homeland Security.\nYou don't expect Border patrol to provide body guard duty to the Secretary of the department of Homeland Security. \nI am making these analogies so the American readers would relate to what is happening, and understand the difference in nomenclature.-- 20:13, 3 May 2007 (UTC)"}

It won 47 seats, while Labour won 46, down from the current 50.\nIt is the first time since the parliament opened that Labour has been beaten, and the first time in fifty years that they have not had a majority of Scottish constituency seats in any election.\nSNP leader Alex Salmond declared: \"Scotland has changed for good and forever.\" He added that the Labour Party had \"lost the moral authority to govern Scotland.\"\nThe current First Minister of Scotland, Jack McConnell of Labour said: \"While I recognise that the SNP are the largest party by the narrowest of margins, Alex Salmond must himself recognise that he does not have a majority in the Scottish Parliament or anywhere near a majority of the vote.\"\nIt is believed that many factors caused the Labour vote to slump and the SNP vote to rise, including the war in Iraq and the renewal of Trident, which are both unpopular in Scotland.\nThe election also raises a serious dilemma for the Labour party's Gordon Brown, a Scotsman widely tipped to succeed Tony Blair as the next prime minister of the United Kingdom. Brown is vehement in his support of the Union, and is a Westminster (London parliament) MP for Kirkcaldy. An SNP government in Scotland will find itself facing the very Labour party it beat in power in London. \nTurnout was up 2% on the last Scottish election.\nControversy.\nThe election was highly controversial, not least for having three separate systems, running in tandem -\nThe three systems, along with difficulties with electronic counting meant that maybe as many as one hundred thousand ballot papers were \"spoiled\". In addition, there was also huge problems with the postal vote.\nDue to the extensive computer problems, votes had to be cancelled early on Friday morning, and postponed to later in the day.\nMany other problems beset the election, with a helicopter from the Western Isles constituency being held up by fog, and a boat carrying ballot papers from the Isle of Arran, breaking down in the Firth of Clyde.\nOther parties.\nIn addition to the SNP and Labour, the other parties results' were as follows -\nThe Scottish Socialist Party, Solidarity and the Scottish Senior Citizens Unity Party were all wiped out.\nIn order to establish a majority in the Scottish Parliament, the SNP must form a coalition with one or more of these parties. The Liberal Democrats, who were in coalition with the Labour party in the first two terms of the Scottish parliament, are a possibility.\nOther parties that campaigned for seats in Holyrood included the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), the British National Party (BNP), the Scottish Unionist Party, the Scottish Socialist Labour Party, the Christian Peoples Alliance and the Scottish Christian Party.\nGains and losses.\nThe Scottish National Party, while not gaining the landslide it had wished for, made breakthroughs in Glasgow (Govan), Edinburgh (Edinburgh East) and also took both seats in Dundee.\nThe Liberal Democrats gained seats in Dunfermline West, but their losses mean the number of seats they hold is unchanged.\nWales and England.\nWhile the Scottish election was going on, the Welsh were also having their election for the Welsh Assembly. Plaid Cymru gained a seat from Labour at Llanelli. The Conservatives had their best showing since the Assembly began.\nThe final results show that the membership for the new assembly will be:- \nLabour 26 -4\nPlaid Cymru 15 +3\nConservatives 12 +1\nLiberal Democrats 6 -\nIndependent 1 -\nIn England, the elections were more minor, dealing only with local authorities. However they can be an important indicator of how battleground seats might go in the General Election, expected in 2-3 years time. The Conservatives made the greatest gains, but did not make the breakthrough in Northern England that they would have hoped. The Liberal Democrats did not make the advances that they had hoped, and stayed at more or less the same level. Elsewhere, Cornish regionalists Mebyon Kernow gained an extra seat bringing their total to seven, and the Eurosceptic United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) and Liberal Party (not to be confused with the Liberal Democrats) gained seats in several areas of England."}

The 26-year-old poultry trader from Sukoharjo, Central Java, died after being hospitalized for three days. If confirmed, this will be the 95th case of human H5N1 infection in Indonesia.\nThe Indonesian daily \"Suara Merdeka\" reports that, in addition to high fever, the victim's symptoms included bronchitis and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). Encephalitis has been reported in other H5N1 cases, including that of a 67-year-old woman from West Java who died in October 2006. In her case, the H5N1 virus was reported to have been found in her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\nThe \"Kedaulatan Rakyat\", a newspaper based in Yogyakarta, reports that following the death of the 26-year-old man on Thursday, 125 of his neighbors have been examined for signs of bird flu and 34 have been tested for the virus. Thirty are reported to have flu-like symptoms but are said to be suffering from seasonal flu.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed a total of 81 H5N1 cases including 63 deaths in Indonesia since 2005. However, there have been at least an additional 13 locally confirmed H5N1 cases including 11 deaths in Indonesia since January 29 of this year. According to these figures, Indonesia has had the highest number (94+) of H5N1 human infections, surpassing Vietnam's total of 93 cases. The WHO has not had access to H5N1 samples from Indonesia since January when a dispute arose over the use of H5N1 samples from Indonesia in commercially made vaccines. \nScientists fear the deadly H5N1 strain could mutate and become easily transmissible among people, triggering a devastating pandemic. According to the WHO, last year in Indonesia a 32-year-old man was probably infected with H5N1 via his 10-year-old son (both died), suggesting that the virus had in that instance acquired the ability to transmit human-to-human, albeit in a limited manner. The father and son were part of a larger, familial cluster in which at least six persons died."}

There are no survivors.\nFlight KQ 507 had 8 crew members, 106 passengers and a flight engineer on board, and was traveling from to . It made a stopover in , Cameroon where more passengers got on the plane before it continued on its flight. The plane sent a distress signal at 2:00 a.m., just after it took off from Cameroon, but it is not known what triggered the distress signal. The plane was supposed to land at 6:15 a.m. local time, but never arrived. It left Abidjan at 11:05 p.m. local time in Nairobi.\n\"All I can say for now is that the wreckage of the plane has been located in the small village of Mbanga Pongo, in the Douala III subdivision. Access to the area is very difficult. We are beginning a new painful phase. Our task will be more difficult now, the task of recovering the corpses,\" said Hamidou Yaya Marafa, Cameroon's Minister of State for Territorial Administration, during a press conference.\nSo far only small portions of the plane have been found, as much of the plane is reported to be underwater.\n\"The plane fell head first. Its nose was buried in the mangrove swamp,\" said chief of meteorology for the Douala airport, Thomas Sobakam.\nReports say that many of the remains of the individuals on board the plane are dismembered and when rescuers attempt to recover the remains, they fall apart in their hands.\n\"It's devastating. I found one or two whole bodies at the start, but since then everything is in pieces. People were afraid of the bodies at the start, so I had to pick them up with my own hands, and they came apart in my fingers,\" said Captain of Cameroon's fire department, Francis Ekosso.\nThere were passengers from 26 different countries on the plane, not including the 9 crew members from Kenya (see list below). Kenya Airways has released the names of all passengers on board Flight KQ 507 (see external links below).\nThe area where the plane went down is reported to be thick with forest, and difficult to reach. Local Fisherman are said to have lead rescuers to the crash site after they heard a \"boom\" and saw \"disturbances in the water.\"\n\"We are told the aircraft was covered by a canopy of trees, and that was the delay in sighting the crash site. The mangrove area is a very tricky area, access is very difficult. I think they will use trekking and boats,\" added Marafa.\nEarlier the chief meteorologist for the airport in , Cameroon, Thomas Sobakam said that \"signs\" of Flight KQ 507 were located, but also said that what was located was not wreckage. Sabakam also said that the reports that wreckage had been found were \"premature.\"\nThe cause of the crash is under investigation, but officials say the plane took off in bad weather and are looking into whether engine failure played a role or not. At least one black box from the plane has been found, but its not known if it was the flight data recorder or the cockpit voice recorder.\nThe next scheduled press briefing will be on Monday, May 7 at 10:00 a.m. local time."}

Participating teams played out a dispute between two WTO members \u2013 one setting aside a pharmaceutical patent (respondent), the other challenging this on behalf of its industry (complainant).\nUnder World Trade Organization rules, a country can sidestep patents by issuing a \"compulsory license\" - a legal mechanism that allows a country to manufacture or import generic versions of patented drugs for public health and national emergencies while paying the patent holder only a small royalty.\nThe global finals last week were the culmination of months of national and regional rounds, with eighteen teams from universities in Europe, North America, Latin America and Asia-Pacific winning a trip to Geneva for the final round. The first semi final was contested by the University of Sydney and the University of Melbourne, while University of Hong Kong and Georgetown University fought out the second semi final.\nIn the grand final at the WTO Centre William Rappard, the University of Melbourne acted for complainant, the Government of Costo (imaginary developed WTO member), while the University of Hong Kong defended the position of the Government of Factoril (imaginary developing WTO member) \u2013 respondent in the matter. \nAfter the two and a half hours of intense debates, the Grand Panel, including Gabrielle Marceau from the WTO Secretariat, Jayashree Watal from the WTO Intellectual Property Division and Werner Zdouc from the WTO Appellate Body Secretariat, decided in favour of complainant. The arguments submitted in favour of protecting the intellectual property rights of the pharmaceutical patent holder were deemed to be better structured and presented which led to the University of Melbourne winning the competition.\n\"The subject of the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health has raised a wide range of issues in the public debate. I think the ELSA Moot Court gave a timely opportunity to bright, young lawyers involved with WTO law to reflect upon and debate the complex legal and political issues raised by this subject,\" said Jatashree Watal, Counsellor, WTO Intellectual Property Division.\nThe students' debates during the final round in Geneva coincided with the decision of the Government of Brazil to put patients' interests before patent holder's interests and issue compulsory license on important AIDS drug. Some parties believe that the economic interests cannot be compared with saving human lives and protecting the public health while others would prefer a more balanced approach to this matter."}

The bodyguard was shot dead in broad daylight while terrified children observed the incident.

The men are alleged to be members of an Islamic radical terror cell who were planning a heavily armed attack against soldiers at the United States Army facility at Fort Dix in New Jersey.\nThe US Attorney's Office said that some of the men were living illegally in the US, while others were legal immigrants. It identified the men as Dritan Duka, Eljvir Duka, Shain Duka, Serdar Tatar, Mohamad Shnewer and Agron Abdullahu. They were said to be four ethnic Albanians (from the former Yugoslavia), one from Turkey, and the sixth man from Jordan.\nReportedly, the FBI had the men under surveillance for 16 months as they trained with both paintball guns and real weapons in the Poconos Mountains area of Pennsylvania. The men video-taped their training and brought the tapes to a camera store to be copied to DVD. The camera store owner alerted the FBI, which then began its investigation.\n\"The Star-Ledger\" reports that the men were lured by an FBI informant into a sting operation to meet with an arms dealer where they wanted to purchase five AK-47 automatic machine guns and three M-16 assault rifles at a residence in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. It was at this point they were arrested.\nU.S. Attorney for New Jersey Christopher J. Christie called the camera store owner who tipped off the FBI to the terror cell \"an American hero\", according to Richard Degener of \"The Press of Atlantic City\". Christie spoke at the Flanders Hotel on Tuesday to the Ocean City Regional Chamber of Commerce. \"The camera store owner saw Muslim men in military garb toting weapons in the woods. He heard them talking about jihad and how Allah was great. He called the FBI and became a hero,\" Christie said.\nOne member of the terror cell was able to gain detailed knowledge of the military base from his work as a pizza delivery driver. The plot was to take over guard posts and \"kill hundreds of Fort Dix soldiers\", Christie said. U.S. Marshal James Plousis joined Christie at the Chamber of Commerce luncheon with 50 area Atlantic City merchants to talk about the value of reporting suspicious activity.\n\"They are not being charged with being members of an international terror organisation,\" said White House spokesperson, Tony Snow. \"However, their involvement in weapons training, operational surveillance and discussions about killing American military personnel warranted a strong law enforcement response.\""}

During that time the entire province was ruled directly from London. Four years ago, few could have expected that Democratic Unionist Party leader Ian Paisley, the preacher known for the longest time in Northern Ireland politics as \"Dr. No\" and Sinn F\u00e9in deputy leader Martin McGuinness, who at one time was an IRA commander, would be sharing power together. However, with the addition of the Saint Andrews Agreement to which both Sinn F\u00e9in and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) agreed, this became a reality.\nIan Paisley will take his post as First Minister of Northern Ireland and Martin McGuinness will serve as his deputy. The DUP receives four cabinet ministers which includes the deputy leader of the party, Peter Robinson, becoming the head of the Department of Finance and Personnel. Sinn F\u00e9in gets three. Meanwhile, the other, less-powerful unionist party, the Ulster Unionist Party receives two which includes UUP leader, Sir Reg Empey heading up the Department for Employment and Learning. Northern Ireland's other mainstream nationalist party, the Social Democratic and Labour Party will head the Department for Social Development.\nReactions.\nBritish Prime Minister Tony Blair said today's events could \"make history anew\" and to \"escape the heavy chains of history\". Blair said, \"Look back and we see centuries pock-marked by conflict, hardship, even hatred, among the people of these islands.\" \nBlair's predecessor, Sir John Major said \"The sight of people that were once totally antagonistic to one another sitting down to plan the future of Northern Ireland is very attractive,\" adding \"I always believed from the outset that it was possible but that it would be difficult and that it would take a long time.\"\nIrish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern thanked his British counterpart saying \"For 10 tough years, he has spent more times dealing with the issues of the island of Ireland than any person ever could have asked any other person to do.\"\nMary McAleese, the President of Ireland said, \"It truly is an extraordinary day in the history of Northern Ireland, the island of Ireland and indeed of relations between Ireland and Britain. You carry the hopes of everybody as you take forward now the mandate you have been given by the people.\" \nIan Paisley said of today's events \"I believe we're starting on a road which will bring us back to peace and to prosperity.\" \nHis new deputy, McGuiness said that they've already taken joint decisions but in the context of not being in power. He said, \"All of that is going to change in the next couple of hours, and by midday today, we're going to be in charge, and we're going to be charged with the responsibility of governing in the interests of the people,\" adding, \"I think we do so in the belief and the sure knowledge that we have the overwhelming support of all of the people of Ireland for what we're about to do.\"\nSinn F\u00e9in president Gerry Adams said, \"I think what today proves is that dialogue and perseverance and tenacity and persistence can bring about results.\" He thanked everyone who helped make today possible and added, \"It's a good day for Ireland, it's a good day for all of the people of this island.\"\nSir Reg Empey stated \"The mission of the Ulster Unionist Party in the months and years ahead, as we rebuild and reform, is to demonstrate that unionism and politics in general is not about a sectarian power-grab.\"\nEmpey's predecessor, Lord David Trimble who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in bringing to peace Northern Ireland with John Hume, the former leader of SDLP said, \" I see it as being the culmination, the final implementation of the agreement that was made on Good Friday in 1998.\"\nMark Durkan, the leader of the SDLP mentioned \"What today shows is that when finally you have a government setting a deadline and setting terms and keeping to them, you can get somewhere,\" stating that Sinn F\u00e9in had underwritten on decommissioning while the DUP had underwritten on power-sharing. He also added that \"It actually took people like the McCartney sisters to show governments how to set terms and hold terms in which the IRA had to move,\" in reference to the sisters of Robert McCartney, a Catholic man murdered by the Provisional IRA last year over what was a pub fight.\nDavid Ford, leader of the cross-communal Alliance Party said \"We are here to make devolution work now, the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in must convince local people that they can work together; much progress has been made but the real work only begins now.\"\nMassachusetts senator Edward Kennedy, who was in Belfast for the event said \"A brighter day has dawned for the people of Northern Ireland, and it would not have been possible without the commitment and determination by all of Northern Ireland's political leaders to find a new way forward,\" and that \"each of them is a profile in courage for our time and all time. Kennedy also said, \"Northern Ireland has shown the world that peace is possible, even in the face of tragic history,\" he stated after attending ceremonies with the American delegation.\nPresident of the United States George W.

Amongst his best known works is the 1958 film \"Maigret tend un pi\u00e8ge\", which he directed.\nAlthough Delannoy was born in a Paris suburb, his family was from Haute-Normandie in the north of France.

After their name became \"De la Noye\" and then \"Delano\", they were on the second ship to emigrate to Plymouth, Massachusetts in America.\nDelannoy was a student in Paris when he began acting in silent films. He eventually landed a job with Paramount Studios Parisian facilities, working his way up to head film editor. In 1934 he directed his first film and went on to a long career, both writing and directing. In 1946, his film about a Protestant minister titled \"La symphonie pastorale\" was awarded the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. In 1960, his film, \"Maigret tend un pi\u00e8ge\" was nominated for a BAFTA award for \"Best Film from any Source.\"\nIn recognition of his long service to the French motion picture industry, Delannoy was given an Honorary C\u00e9sar Award in 1986."}

It was during this time that he undertook his first ethnographic fieldwork, conducting periodic research forays into the Mato Grosso and the Amazon Rainforest. He studied first the Guaycuru and Bororo Indian tribes, actually living among them for a while. Several years later, he returned for a second, year-long expedition to study the Nambikwara and Tupi-Kawahib societies. It was this experience that cemented L\u00e9vi-Strauss's professional identity as an anthropologist. Edmund Leach suggests, from L\u00e9vi-Strauss's own accounts in Tristes-Tropiques, that he could not have spent more than a few weeks with any place and was never able to converse easily with any of his native informants in their native language.\nThe war years in New York were formative for L\u00e9vi-Strauss in several ways. His relationship with Roman Jakobson helped shape his theoretical outlook (Jakobson and L\u00e9vi-Strauss are considered to be two of the central figures on which structuralist thought is based). In addition, L\u00e9vi-Strauss was also exposed to the American anthropology espoused by Franz Boas, who taught at Columbia University on New York's Upper West Side. In 1942 in fact, while having dinner at the Faculty House at Columbia, Boas died of a heart attack in L\u00e9vi-Strauss's arms. This intimate association with Boas gave his early work a distinctive American tilt that helped facilitate its acceptance in the U.S. After a brief stint from 1946 to 1947 as a cultural attach\u00e9 to the French embassy in Washington, DC, L\u00e9vi-Strauss returned to Paris in 1948. It was at this time that he received his doctorate from the Sorbonne by submitting, in the French tradition, both a \"major\" and a \"minor\" thesis. These were The Family and Social Life of the Nambikwara Indians and The Elementary Structures of Kinship.\nL\u00e9vi-Strauss' later works are more controversial, in part because they impinge on the subject matter of other scholars. He believed that modern life and all history was founded on the same categories and transformations that he had discovered in the Brazilian back country \u2013 The Raw and the Cooked, From Honey to Ashes, The Naked Man (to borrow some titles from the Mythologiques). For instance he compares anthropology to musical serialism and defends his \"philosophical\" approach. He also pointed out that the modern view of primitive cultures was simplistic in denying them a history. The categories of myth did not persist among them because nothing had happened \u2013 it was easy to find the evidence of defeat, migration, exile, repeated displacements of all the kinds known to recorded history. Instead, the mythic categories had encompassed these changes.\nL\u00e9vi-Strauss is survived by his wife Monique Roman and two sons."}

The Liberal Party lead by Dalton McGuinty will spend the next four years in a majority government.\nMcGuinty is the first Liberal premier to have back-to-back majorities since Mitchell Hepburn, who held office from 1934-1942, with his second majority starting in 1937. Hepburn's government legacy includes the Queen Elizabeth Way and Rainbow Bridge to Niagara Falls, New York.\nMcGuinty wins, Tory doesn't get seat.\nMcGuinty was re-elected in his riding of Ottawa South.\nIn his speech, McGuinty told supporters \"For this great privilege I am profoundly grateful.\" He continued by stating that the party \"deplore[s] negativity,\" and that no one should \"mistake our civility as a weakness.\"\nProgressive Conservative (PC) leader John Tory was defeated by Liberal candidate Kathleen Wynne in the riding of Don Valley West. He previously held a seat in his former riding of Dufferin\u2014Peel\u2014Wellington\u2014Grey. A leadership election will be held if Tory resigns his position, a move he has so far avoided.\nAsking hypothetically \"Is [Tory] a little too progressive for the Conservatives?\", Liberal Gerard Kennedy on CTV echoed the thoughts of many media outlets, who feel the faith-based school funding was the key blow to Tory's campaign. Tory called McGuinty to concede at 10:30 p.m. McGuinty was first to make a televised speech, despite the general practice of winners speaking last.\nNew Democratic (NDP) leader Howard Hampton was re-elected in his riding of Kenora\u2014Rainy River.\nGreen Party leader Frank de Jong ran in Burlington earlier this year in a by-election, but lost to a PC strong-hold candidate. He ran again in the riding of Davenport, but lost to Liberal Mario Silva.\nAs of 23:40 EDT with 57.6% of the polls reporting:\nResults trickled in for most of the early evening, due to the clog of visitors to its public website. At 9:49 p.m. ET last night, CTV told viewers that they were only receiving result updates every ten seconds at top speed, compared to a test run of ten results per second. They speculated at the time that the computers' new software was to blame. The media outlets were still calling victories early in the evening, with one station unironically declaring a candidate with seven votes (compared to two others with three apiece) as \"well up in front\".\nFormer PC Premier Ernie Eves, NDP MP Olivia Chow, and former Liberal education minister Gerard Kennedy appeared as commentators throughout the evening. Former Ontario Liberal MPP Alvin Curling, who was the first Black speaker of the Ontario Legislature, and former Deputy Prime Minister Sheila Copps were among those on Citytv Toronto. Global's panelists included Warren Kinsella, Jane Pitfield and Marilyn Churley, while CHCH News hosted Liberal MP Garth Turner.\nFirst Nations representative Regional Chief Angus Toulouse congratulated McGuinty on his re-election, suggesting this would allow the chance to build on an existing relationship, rather than start anew. \"There is a lot of work to do in follow up to the important recommendations outlined in the Final Report of the Ipperwash Inquiry. This work must be done jointly and in a collaborative manner and I am encouraged by the fact that the Premier, and the Government, have committed to address this in partnership with First Nations.\"\n\"Wikinews\" has a full selection of in-depth interviews with 53 candidates; see Ontario Votes 2007. You may view other articles about Canada and Ontario at Wikinews' .\"\nReferendum on electoral reform.\nThe election included a referendum on electoral reform, asking voters whether to replace the existing plurality voting system with a Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) voting system. MMP lost as the existing system was favoured by a margin of 63.0%, based on unofficial referendum results as at 23:40 EDT.\nThroughout the night, many outlets stated the opinion that the referendum was poorly promoted. Even Toronto's Mayor David Miller, appearing on TVO at 9:56 p.m., called the proposed process \"MPMP\". Some outlets, like the Owen Sound Sun Times called the referendum process \"set up to fail\".\nWhile only 50% of eligible voters cast a ballot in the general election, 54% cast a referendum ballot.\nThe Canadian Federation of Students-Ontario chairperson Jen Hassum commented that the \"projected defeat of Mixed Member Proportional reinforces a massive generational divide in Ontario. Recent polling showed that 67 per cent of voters under the age of 35 supported the new voting system.\""}

A Hamas building, which the organisation said was an administrative office of its bodyguard unit, was destroyed. A top Hamas commander riding in one of the cars was killed.\nThe air strike follows warnings from Israel that it will respond to repeated rocket attacks coming from Palestinian areas. Miri Eisin, spokeswoman for the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, said: \"We have had enough. Israel will take all defensive measures to protect our citizens from these Hamas rockets.\" Hamas military spokesman Abu Obaida has threatened to retaliate against Israeli settlers and suggested using suicide bombing. \nIsraeli armoured units moved into northern Gaza, taking up preparatory positions, an unidentified army spokeswoman told Bloomberg. \nThe strike comes in the middle of heavy fighting between forces loyal to Fatah and to Hamas, part of the ongoing Palestinian factional violence.\nThis was the third Israeli strike in two days."}

However the conclusion had to be drawn that there is a need to review the governance framework of the World Bank Group and in particular procedural and other aspects of the Ethics Committee.\nThe Directors pay tribute to the service that Wolfowitz has given to the World Bank, citing a number of achievements, particularly a number of initiatives involving countries and relief programmes in Africa. They also added regret that the recent events had overshadowed his achievements at the Bank.\nIn a separate and lengthy statement, Wolfowitz outlined many of the achievements of the Bank during his time as President, and acknowledged the contribution of those working for the Bank in the delivery of its programmes and support for a wide range of organisations throughout the world. He considered however that his resignation was in the best interests of the Bank.\nWolfowitz had enjoyed considerable support from the US Administration, and particular endorsement from President Bush and Vice-President Cheney. However he had been less popular with other governments around the world, particularly in Europe."}

He and his fellow pilot, Giles Cardozo, who had invented and developed the parajet engine, set out on their attempt from the Himalayan village of Pheriche (altitude 14,435ft (4,400m)) in the early morning of 14th May.\nGrylls, 33, is a mountaineer, best selling author and television presenter who spent three years with the elite British Special Air Service (\"SAS\") forces. During this time he was involved in a horrific parachuting accident in which he broke his back in three places, almost severing his spinal cord. Remarkably, in 1998, after months of rehabilitation, he became at 23, the youngest British climber to scale Mount Everest and return alive.\nCardozo is considered to be one of the top paragliding pilots in the world, and it is reported that he and Grylls first came up with the idea for the attempt about a year ago when he had invented the engine that would take them up the mountain.\nGrylls and Cardozo flew their paragliders together to 28,001ft (8,353m) surviving temperatures of minus 76\u00b0F (-60\u00b0C) and dangerously low oxygen levels, when a fault developed in Cardozo's engine, and he had to abort his attempt just 984ft (300m) below the summit. Grylls went on to reach his record height at 09.33 local time. He had originally intended to cross the Mountain but turned back to base camp fearing that he might be arrested if he entered Chinese airspace.\nOn his return to Kathmandu, Grylls voiced his feelings of loneliness and exhilaration:\nThe attempt was sponsored by British technology and engineering group GKN. The project, GKN Mission Everest, raised \u00a3500,000 (approximately $1m) for Global Angels, a charity helping children in Africa, Asia and Latin America.\nParaglider survives at 32,000 feet.\nIn a separate incident, a German paragliding champion has survived being sucked up by a storm to a height of 32,612ft (9,940m) whilst preparing for a world paragliding championship in Manilla, New South Wales, Australia. \nEwa Wisnierska, 35, the 2005 World Cup paragliding winner, lost consciousness and was covered in ice and battered by orange-sized hailstones as she was pulled upwards by the sudden tornado-like storm which she had been attempting to skirt. After regaining consciousness as she descended she was able to make contact with her ground team which had been tracking her by her GPS equipment, and landed safely 40 miles (60km) from where she took off.\nRemarkably she spent only an hour in hospital after her experience, being treated for frostbite and blistering to her face and ears.\nA fellow competitor, 42 year old Chinese man, He Zhongpin, who was also caught up in the storm, was not so fortunate and died from lack of oxygen and the extreme cold."}

When he began to drive away, the press got a few pictures of Bush with no seatbelt on.\nSnow was also asked if the Secret Service was required to make Bush wear a seatbelt, to which he replied \"the Secret Service, I guarantee you, looks after the president and is absolutely determined to ensure his safety in every way possible.\"\nDespite the pictures, in Texas, it is not a violation of any law, as seat belts are not required to be worn on private property.\n\"On private property, you're not required to wear your seat belt,\" said Texas Department of Public Safety spokeswoman, Tela Mange who also added that driving on private property with no seat belt is \"fairly common.\""}

Its former leader, ousted prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra and 110 party leaders are banned from politics for five years, the court also ruled.\nThaksin, responding to the ruling from London, told the BBC: \"We have to respect the rules of the game. That is, the rule of the law. If the rules of the law are observed, we have to respect it.\"\nBut Thaksin's lawyer and spokesman in Bangkok, Noppadon Pattama, called the verdict \"unexpected\", and told Reuters, \"It's too harsh on Thai Rak Thai.\"\nEarlier, the nation's main opposition party, the Democrat Party, was acquitted of six charges of election fraud, and allowed to remain intact.\nThe tribunal was reviewing violations that took place during the April 2, 2006 general elections, which were declared invalid due to widespread charges of corruption and vote buying. Another election was scheduled for October 2006, but after a military-led coup on September 19, that election was never held.\nThai Rak Thai (literally \"Thais love Thais\"), was formerly headed by Thaksin, a telecommunications tycoon and ex-prime minister who was ousted in last year's coup.\nThe tribunal said two party leaders, former deputy leader Thamarak Isarangura and former deputy secretary-general Pongsak Ruktapongpisal, hired two smaller parties to contest the April election on behalf of Thai Rak Thai. The two were Cabinet members at the time. The Tribunal also dissolved the two implicated smaller parties, Pattana Chart Thai and Pandin Thai, and banned their executives from politics for five years.\nThai Rak Thai lawyers countered that the party's top leadership could not have known about Thamarak and Pongsak's plans, but the judges dismissed that assertion.\n\"The Thai Rak Thai party did not respect the rule of law despite the fact that they won elections twice,\" said one of the judges in his ruling. \"Thai Rak Thai cannot exist as a political party, therefore the court orders to dissolve the Thai Rak Thai party.\"\nThai Rak Thai acting leader Chaturon Chaisang said that the ban was \"totally unexpected\", but he urged supporters to not fight the decision. \"Even if we don't agree with the ruling, I ask all Thai Rak Thai members not to protest or oppose the ruling,\" he said. \nThe final verdict was read at 11:36 p.m. local time (1636 GMT), and came after a long, suspenseful afternoon and evening of proceedings that began at 2 p.m. The proceedings were broadcast on all of Thailand's television channels, and local newspapers updated their coverage in real time on their websites.\nIn the run-up to what was called \"Judgement Day\" in the local media, tensions were high. Interim Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont warned that he would impose a state of emergency if there was any violence. Thousands of security officers were stationed at checkpoints across the capital, with a 15,000-strong security force at the ready in their barracks. The junta also ordered that some political websites be blocked. King Bhumibol Adulyadej made a rare televised address when he granted an audience to the court's judges, and urged them to use care in their deliberations.\nSome schools were closed out of security concerns, but there were no signs of large protests. Fewer than 200 people gathered quietly behind police barricades across the road from the court, and parties kept their supporters away from the site.\nThe Democrat Party faced six charges, among them accusations that it had paid off members of two smaller parties, the Progressive Democrat Party and the Better Life Party, to frame Thai Rak Thai of trying to buy their votes. But the Democrats were acquitted on all charges.\n\"The facts cannot prove that the Democrats did any wrongdoing so there is no reason to dissolve the Democrats,\" said Thanit Kesawapitak, one of nine tribunal judges.\nHowever, the Progressive Democratic Party was found guilty of rigging its membership records, and ordered dissolved. Furthermore, the party's leaders are banned from politics for five years. The party was found guilty of falsifying its membership records to enable its candidates to run in three constituencies in Trang.\nDemocrat Party members sitting in the court room appeared to be relieved as they heard the verdict read.\nAt the Democrats' headquarters, the mood was celebratory. Crowds lined the streets to the offices, and leaders were greeted with cheers and applause and given bouquets of flowers.\n\"Today's victory is for people and the country,\" Democrat leader Abhisit Vejjajiva told supporters. \"Today is the end of pressure on the party and the people. What I wish from is that the Council of National Security and the government holds the national election as promised and as scheduled,\" he said.\nThe Council of National Security, the junta's ruling body, has promised a national referendum on a new constitution, with elections by December.\nThe Democrat Party is Thailand's oldest political party, founded in 1945, and has mainly been an opposition party. With Chuan Leekpai as prime minister, the Democrats led coalition governments from 1992 to 1995 and again from 1997 to 2001, when Thaksin and Thai Rak Thai were swept to power on a tide of populist sentiment. Since being ousted in last year's coup, Thaksin has lived in self-imposed exile outside Thailand, mainly in London.\nNow, with Thai Rak Thai removed from the scene, the Democrats are likely to return to power if the promised elections are held, said Michael Montesano, who teaches Thai politics at the National University of Singapore."}

RCTV was not the only media station to support the coup but, they have been closed because many say that they are the most significant TV station of the opposition. Venevision which supported the coup at the time has recently had its license renewed for 5 more years, which many say is due for their change in their editorial stance. \nThe protests.\nProtests began with opposition marches over the weekend. Shortly after the closing of RCTV, large student demonstrations appeared throughout the capital city of Caracas. The protests have continued all week and have spread throughout the country. Most of the student protests have originated from universities which are not aligned with Chavez; he says that the students do not like the public universities that threaten and compete with the non-aligned schools.\nProtesters threw rocks at police officers, who have responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. Some protesters were arrested, and many were injured. Most were students.\nSpontaneous rallies by government supporters have also appeared, supporting Hugo Chavez's decision. These protests were not the same size as some of the student protests. The police and national guard have been working to make sure that these opposing groups do not clash together.\nMany websites related to the opposition have been down due to either high internet traffic or, theoretically, because CanTV; a large Venezuelan Telecommunications company, will not allow access to these websites in Venezuela. There is not much evidence for the supposed intervention by CanTV and is not much more than speculation at this point. Nonetheless, many websites and blogs have reported such incidents.\nChavez's statements.\nChavez has repeatedly stated that the protests are organized by opposition forces wishing to destabilize the government much like the coup d'\u00e9tat attempt that took place five years earlier. \nHugo Ch\u00e1vez has also repeatedly threatened the TV station Globovisi\u00f3n, which is the only significant opposition voice on television. Chavez claims that they encouraged his assassination and also helped the effort to unseat him during the 2002 coup d'\u00e9tat attempt.\nReactions.\nThe closure of RCTV has been condemned in the United States and the European Union. The U.S Senate has passed a resolution expressing \"profound concern of the Senate regarding the transgression and freedom of thought and expression that is being carried out in Venezuela.\" \nU.S House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has made this statement about the incident: \"President Chavez should know that efforts to suppress the media will not only ultimately fail, but are also a detriment to one of the pillars of democracy: freedom of expression.\" Pelosi also said in a statement Wednesday in Washington. \"He should reconsider this ill-advised decision.\"\nThe press freedom advocacy group Reporters Without Borders called the closure \"a serious violation of freedom of expression and a major setback to democracy and pluralism,\" and urged the international community to rally in defence of press freedom. \nMuch like the French protests last year, students are using technology to their advantage; cell phones to communicate and video from phones is being broadcast on YouTube and other video sharing websites. Videos that have been uploaded to YouTube are considered to be the most graphic, as television stations in Venezuela fear repercussion if they broadcast the footage."}

{"id": "70803", "revid": "39076", "url": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=70803", "title": "Philadelphia breaks 80 year old building lease; moves to evict Scouts", "text": "In an unannounced vote yesterday, the Philadelphia City Council in the United States voted 16-1 to endorse the eviction of, and end their lease held \"in perpetuity\" with, the local council of the Boy Scouts in Philadelphia. The Scouts must pay market rent or leave the building. The Cradle of Liberty Council has more than 60,000 members in Philadelphia and Delaware and Montgomery Counties. \nBackground.\nIn a surprise move, the Philadelphia City Council voted to revoke the lease it signed with the Boy Scouts for the use of the land on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway in 1928 \"in perpetuity.\" This clears the way for the eviction of the Scouts from the building in July 2007, one year after having been given their eviction notice. The vote of the council was needed to confirm Mayor Street\u2019s eviction notice.\nThe on-going dispute between the city and the Scouts is one of the controversies over the issue of avowed homosexuals being leaders in the Boy Scouts. The city of Philadelphia does not allow discrimination against openly gay people, and the Scouts have asserted that under the First Amendment Freedom of assembly they can exclude people who don\u2019t meet their membership standards.\nIn December 1928 the City of Philadelphia gave the Philadelphia Council permission to build a headquarters on city-owned land at 22nd and Spring Streets in Fairmount Park. The Scouts built their headquarters at their own expense and, complying with the terms of the agreement, immediately turned over the property to the city. In return they remained housed in their building rent free.\nThe Scouts have a non-discrimination policy, but have refused to include sexual orientation in their non-discrimination charter. This is due to pressure form the Mormon and Catholic churches, two of the largest sponsors of Scouting units. The Scouts require an oath of duty to God and the group's rules prohibit participation by any person who is an avowed homosexual. The policy over the exclusion of openly gay leaders had been challenged in court, but in 2000 the U.S. Supreme Court confirmed that as a private group, the Scouts could set restrictions for their leaders.\nGay activists then turned their sights on arrangements such as that in Berkeley (California) and Philadelphia, where the Scouts had been using public land rent free. In 2003 the council said it would adopt a nondiscrimination policy on homosexuals, but reversed itself within days under pressure from the National Council.\nThe resolution was introduced unexpectedly by Councilman Darrell L. Clarke and passed, 16-1, with no debate, with only Council Minority Leader Brian J. O'Neill voting against the resolution. \"My hope is that the resolution will give a little more leverage to the city and that [the parties] can come up with some kind of compromise,\" Clarke said. \"Honestly, no one wants to see them out of there.\"\nA spokesman for the Cradle of Liberty Council, said scout officials were disappointed at the council vote and that they were not told in advance. \"This is the way it's been done all along,\" said Jeff Jubelirer. \"We feel we haven't been dealt with fairly.\" The Scouts are caught between a rock and a hard place. If they adopt the non-discrimination policy demanded by the city, they lose their national charter from the Boy Scouts. \"The real victims here are the 40,000 kids in Philadelphia who potentially could lose after-school programs at a time when Philadelphia's murder rate is soaring,\" Jubelirer said. \nCity Solicitor Romulo Diaz, himself openly gay, said yesterday \"The ball is in the [Cradle of Liberty] council's court.\" Equality Advocates Pennsylvania, which promotes legal equality for sexual minorities and pressed the city on the scouts' lease, yesterday praised the Council vote. \"We recognize the value of the Boy Scouts programs to some young people. They, however, should not be able to use taxpayers' dollars to discriminate against others,\" said executive director Stacey Sobel. \nJubelirer said the Scouts felt \"blindsided\" by Council's action. \"We had no idea this was coming today,\" he said they learned of the resolution from a lobbyist who was in council chambers when the resolution was introduced. \"When the Fairmount Park commission voted to evict us [last July] we didn't get invited to the meeting. There's been a pattern of the city not giving us any information and doing things at the eleventh hour behind our backs.\" Councilman O'Neill said \"This was too big an issue to have no hearing on,\" he said after the vote. \"The Boy Scouts were negotiating in good faith. They were negotiating to be paid for the improvements they made to the building so they could start again somewhere else. \"The local chapter was opposed to the national chapter's discrimination policy. I hate to see a group that agrees with us to be pushed out.\"\nThe future.\nThe Boy Scouts can continue to use their building if they agree to pay market value rent. Jubelirer said the city has yet to tell the Cradle of Liberty Council what fair-market-value rent would be. Clarke said he opposes the fair-market-value rent alternative. \"You should not be able to stay in a publicly funded facility without signing nondiscriminatory language regardless of whether you pay rent,\" he said.\nJubelirer said he did not know how scout officials would react and that any decision would likely involve leadership of the scout's National Council. \"We walk a fine line between what National wants and what we want to do,\" Jubelirer said. \nIn February 2007, Bill Dwyer, the Scout Executive, announced to the board and the staff that the council could not afford to keep up the legal fight to remain at 22nd and Winter, and there was not the community support to force the mayor to change his decision to evict the Scouts. \nPreparation began to abandon the building and build a new facility on private land. The new building will be built on along with the Salvation Army's new facilities in North Philadelphia."}

However, a ban on forming new political parties remains in effect, until at least next week. Government spokesman Nattawat Suthiyothin said a bill on new parties would be forwarded to the National Legislative Assembly. And the Cabinet says that the ban on leaders of dissolved political parties remains in effect.\nPolitical gatherings and activities had been banned by the junta since the military's overthrow of the civilian government in September of last year. But in the face of recent protests, the military's ruling body, the Council for National Security, agreed on Monday to recommend that political activities be allowed.\nThe move by the Cabinet comes six days after a Constitutional Tribunal in which the former ruling party, Thai Rak Thai was ordered dissolved and its leaders, including ousted prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra banned from politics for five years. Thai Rak Thai was found guilty of violations in the April 2006 general election. Another prominent party, the opposition Democrat Party, was also on trial, but was allowed to remain intact.\nThough the junta has outlawed political gatherings, demonstrations have still been tolerated in Bangkok. One of the largest came on Saturday, when 6,000 supporters of a satellite television station, PTV, held a rally. The pro-Thaksin PTV has been taken off the air by the junta, as have several pro-Thaksin websites. The junta also ordered that text messages be sent to mobile-phone subscribers, asking them to stay away from demonstrations.\nBut the junta has shown signs of moving the nation back towards the democratic process, with the leader of the coup, Council for National Security chairman General Sonthi Boonyaratglin suggesting an amnesty for the banned political leaders. The idea was widely criticized, though, and Sonthi later retracted his statement, saying the amnesty notion had been proposed by the National Legislative Assembly."}

There were no government contracts.\u201d\n expressed some concern over the allegations. \"The charges in the indictment against Congressman Jefferson are extremely serious,\u201d said Pelosi. \u201cWhile Mr. Jefferson, just as any other citizen, must be considered innocent until proven guilty, if these charges are proven true, they constitute an egregious and unacceptable abuse of public trust and power.\u201d \nIf found guilty of the charges ultimately, Representative Jefferson faces a maximum sentence of 235 years."}

The organization has offered to buy the land for no more than $500,000 at least three times.\nCurrently, the U.S. National Park Service only owns approximately 60 acres of the land. PBS Coals Inc. owns 864 acres of the land and Svonavec owns 273 acres. The entire field is nearly 2,000 acres.\nThe permanent memorial is estimated to cost $58 million and is scheduled to be constructed starting in 2008 or 2009. On the ten-year anniversary of 9/11, a ribbon will be cut at the site.\nSvonavec has also placed a box on the crash site temporary memorial, where visitors can leave a \"donation\" to pay for his asking price for the land as well as the cost of providing security at the site. Funding was provided for the cost of security, but in February the funds were already used up and Svonavec says he can no longer afford to keep the land maintained and secure. Reports say that the security company that is currently in charge of security charges $10,000 per month. \n\"That land has been paid for with 40 lives...the donation box is an insult to that cost. I think Svonavec believes his land, because it has the blood of my cousin and 39 other people, it's worth more,\" said Patrick White, Vice President, \"Families of Flight 93\"."}

Concern was high for the oil industry, as rough seas kept tankers from leaving their ports.\nSuch storms are rare in the Middle East. Early today, Gonu was weakening and was downgraded to a tropical storm. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center projected the storm to continue weakening as it made landfall on Iran's southeastern coast. Offshore Iranian oil installations were expected to be spared, officials said.\nOman lashed.\nIn the Omani capital, Muscat yesterday, there were torrential rains and howling winds, a rarity in the quiet coastal city. Streets were flooded and emergency vehicles were useless. Flights were canceled at Oman's Seeb International Airport.\nTwenty-three deaths were reported by Omani authorities today. Electricity and phone lines were out and roads flooded. Police said a body washed ashore in Sur. There were also reports of people trapped in homes in low-lying areas of the capital.\nAuthorities used mobile-phone text messages to warn people away from dangerous areas. Residents were warned to stay at home, or seek shelter in buildings that could withstand the harsh weather.\nShareefa bint Khalfan, Omani minister of social development, said more than 20,000 people were evacuated to government shelters. \nAt Oman's weather center, where records have been kept since 1890, metorologists said Gonu was likely the strongest storm to hit Oman since 1977. Milder tropical storms are common mid-May to late June.\nIran prepares.\nIn Iran, hundreds of residents of Chabahr, a port on the Gulf of Oman, were evacuated.\n\"University and school students were moved to higher ground in the area to avoid the cyclone effects,\" Hojjat Ali Shayanfar, head of emergency services in Sistan Baluchistan province, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press.\nSome major roads were flooded in southeastern Iran. In the port city of Bandar Abbas, winds shattered windows and knocked down billboards &amp; trees.\nImpact on oil industry.\nOman has relatively small oil fields, and there was little damage to them. But oil exports were cut off, as the raging seas kept tankers battened down in port for a third day today. To the north, at the world's third-largest shipping fuel center in Fujairah, United Arab Emirates, all refueling and supply operations were suspended, and ships were kept in their berths. At the entrance to the Persian Gulf, the Strait of Hormuz, ships passed through, despite four- to six-foot swells and strong winds. About one-fifth of the world's oil passes through this narrow chokepoint.\nIran, OPEC's No. 2 oil exporter, said the storm would not disrupt supplies because its main terminals were inside the Gulf waterway. Analysts were mixed on how the storm will affect prices at the gas pump.\n\"About 17-21 million barrels a day of oil are coming out of the Persian Gulf. Even if only some of the tankers are delayed, that could reduce the supply of oil and increase prices,\" Manouchehr Takin, at the Center for Global Energy Studies in London, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press.\nBut Tim Evans, an analyst at Citigroup Global Markets, said while the storm may delay oil tankers, they will eventually get to their destinations, so prices shouldn't be affected too drastically.\nOil prices rose US$0.25 to $65.86 a barrel in midday trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\nStrongest cyclone.\nAt its peak, Tropical Cyclone Gonu, named for a bag of palm leaves in the language of the Maldives, reached sustained winds of 240 kilometers an hour (149 miles per hour) . By early today, winds were around 83 km/h, and it was expect to keep weakening.\nThe storm is believed to be the strongest cyclone to hit the Arabian Peninsula since record-keeping started in 1945, and was tied for the strongest tropical cyclone in the northern Indian Ocean, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.\nSources.\n&lt;/noinclude&gt;"}

While France and Germany are calling for quantifiable greenhouse gas emission cuts, the U.S. and Japan believe that growing economies such as India and China would need to join in on such efforts.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel at the G8 summit yesterday said the two main topics were climate change and combating poverty in Africa. She said her first talks with president Bush were good, and added: \"I trust that we will work out joint positions on that.\" Bush acknowledged that he has \"strong desire to work ... on a post-Kyoto agreement.\"\nMerkel had proposed a 50% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 compared to 1990 levels, helping to keep global temperature rise to no more than 3.6\u00b0C. White House adviser James Connaughton however said that \"At this point in time we are not prepared to adopt that proposal.\"\nPresident George W. Bush finds himself in a position between the pressure from France and Germany, but on the other hand he wants to urge countries like India and China to join climate efforts. He told reporters that: \"The United States can serve as a bridge between some nations who believe that now is the time to come up with a set goal \u2026 and those who are reluctant to participate in the dialogue. ... We all can make major strides, and yet there won't be a reduction until China and India are participants.\"\nPresident Bush will defend his plan today to organise a separate conference on global warming with the 15 biggest polluters to set their own goals, and to rely on technological innovations to achieve part of the emission targets. When asked about the U.S. plans, Merkel said in a television interview that she didn't expect the differences to disappear overnight. At the G8 summit she said stated: \"I think we all know that the goals agreed by the European Union cannot be accepted by the entire world.\"\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters: \"On climate change ...We agreed that Japan and the United States would be working together for the creation of an effective framework which is flexible, and that we would be cooperating to achieve that end in the future.\"\nThe new President of France Nicolas Sarkozy wants the U.S. to increase their efforts on climate issues. He told reporters yesterday: \"We need quantifiable targets in the final text. It is an extremely important point and I intend to talk to the president of the United States about it as early as this evening. ... President Bush has made a first effort, but we need to set ourselves targets to clearly show the determination of the G-8 to act and to obtain results... If we don't act now, it will be too late to avoid a disaster. It will cost less than if we wait.\"\nA spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin called the U.S. plans to deal with global warming \"very pragmatic and interesting.\" Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi recognised that \"the American president has made comments in the last few days that have been more open than in the past.\" Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair also welcomed the U.S. engagement for \"substantial\" reductions, which the U.S. is aiming for, according to a recent U.S. draft G8 document.\nPresident of the European Commission Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso at the G8 summit said he thought the E.U. was taking a leading role in the climate debate, also by influencing the position of countries like the U.S. and China. He believes a global agreement to follow Kyoto is needed, possibly by 2009. He stressed that, as this was a problem created by all nations, effecting all, it had to be tackled within the UN-framework, and that agreements made by only a number of states would fall short of what is needed. He also doubted the possibility that hard numbers on emissions cuts would result from this summit.\nOther topics at the G8 Summit will be development in Africa (including the fight against AIDS and malaria), the Doha Round of the World Trade Organization, and the U.S. plans to set up a missile defence shield in Europe.\nThe U.S. is the only G8 country that has not ratified the Kyoto protocol, which expires in 2012."}

The scouts must abandon their building before the end of July. Local scouts now have to go to suburbs for services.\nBackground.\nWith the eviction of the Cradle of Liberty Council, Philadelphia, the fifth largest city in the nation, is the only one without its own Scout building. The four largest cities are each served respectively by their own council: Greater New York Councils; Los Angeles Area Council; Chicago Area Council and the Sam Houston Area Council. Cities six through ten have council offices within their city limits as well (Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, Dallas and San Jose).\nThe Philadelphia-based council is the seventh largest in the nation. The top five are New York, Houston, the Washington-BaltimoreArea (National Capital Area Council), Saint Paul (Northern Star Council) and Salt Lake City (Great Salt Lake Council).\nIn December 1928 the City of Philadelphia gave the Philadelphia Council permission to build a headquarters on city-owned land at 22nd and Spring Streets in Fairmount Park. The Scouts built their headquarters at their own expense and, complying with the terms of the agreement, immediately turned over the property to the city. In return they remained housed in their building rent free \"in perpetuity.\"\nThe Beaux Arts style building built in 1929 was designed by architect Charles Klauder. Located at 22nd and Winter Streets it is eligible to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Having lost the use of the land and building on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway given to the council, it will operate out of its suburban office in Wayne, Pennsylvania. This office is 21 miles outside of Center City, considered the heart of the Delaware Valley.\nThe eviction of the council is due to the controversies over the issue of avowed homosexuals being leaders in the Boy Scouts. The city of Philadelphia does not allow discrimination against openly gay people, and the Scouts have asserted that under the First Amendment Freedom of assembly they can exclude people who don\u2019t meet their membership standards.\nThere is no word about the Scouts future plans in Philadelphia and Scout officials have not yet commented on it. The council is still recovering from the loss of United Way funding in 2003."}

PBS Coals Inc. owns 864 acres of the land and Svonavec owns 273 acres. The entire field is nearly 2,000 acres."}

Yesterday, Kouchner met with Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir.\nUntil Sunday, Chad had rejected the idea of allowing military troops in to assist with security at its border with Sudan. In Chad's eastern region, the government has been fighting an insurgency, which it claims has been supported by Sudan. While dealing with the insurgency, Chad had been amenable to an international police presence, but not a military force. \nAn estimated 234,000 Sudanese refugees have fled the violence in the Darfur region of Sudan and crossed the border into Chad. In addition, Chad is coping with an estimated 150,000 internally displaced persons. The conditions in the camps set up to deal with the refugees have been criticised as inadequate by the aid group, (MSF).\nFrance's newly appointed foreign minister, and co-founder of MSF, Bernard Kouchner, and Chad's President D\u00e9by were able to work out some concessions on the use of foreign troops. Following the meeting, D\u00e9by was asked by reporters whether he would allow UN or EU military troops to take a role in security and stabilization measures for a humanitarian mission. \"Why not,\" D\u00e9by replied.\nD\u00e9by revealed that plans for an international force for Chad would be made public by the end of June. \"We are agreed on the principle of deploying a force, but there are still some points to resolve, on which we must agree,\" said D\u00e9by. \"The results of the discussions will be made public before the 25th of this month.\"\n\"We have been proposing this to the international community since 2004,\" said D\u00e9by. But Chad's Prime Minister, , commented recently that neighbouring countries may take the use of foreign troops as a threat.\nOn June 9, MSF issued a press release warning of a humanitarian crisis developing in Chad. \"It is imperative that the emergency in eastern Chad be fully recognised, that aid organisations provide massive, immediate aid to the IDPs and that the Chadian authorities facilitate humanitarian aid,\" said Isabelle Defourny, manager of MSF programmes in Chad.\nProgress in Sudan.\nFollowing his visit to Chad, Foreign Minister Kouchner traveled to Sudan where he met with Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir. Sudan has, in the past, rejected the deployment of an international force, and has resisted the use of a UN-African Union (AU) force. During their meeting Monday, al-Bashir told Kouchner that he would only accept troops from Africa.\nKouchner indicated that his meetings with al-Bashir and other officials had been productive and would \"lift a certain number of complications\" in obtaining agreements with Sudan. He and al-Bashir also discussed the unilateral sanctions imposed on Sudan by the United States. Kouchner felt that the sanctions haven't been useful and that the Sudanese \"seem clearly affected by this issue, considering how much they raised it.\"\nUN Secretary-General expressed some optimism on the issue of troop deployment and acknowledged he received a letter recently from al-Bashir on the matter. As stated in the letter, al-Bashir has accepted in principal the idea of a UN-AU force of 23,000 troops to be stationed in Darfur. \"I sincerely hope that we will be able to have early resolution of this issue,\" said Ban.\nOne roadblock may be al-Bashir's refusal to accept any force other than African. The UN and AU stated they would attempt to use only African troops, but indicated that non-African troops may be used if that were not possible.\n\"Darfur cannot be only an African problem,\" said Kouchner. \"At a certain level, the respect for human rights concerns the whole world.\""}

At the heart of this strategy is BT Global Services, which has won many significant contracts in the commercial and public sectors, in part through its portrayal as a \"momentum story\".\nThere is, however, increasing disquiet among analysts that the annual growth of the Global Services business has been unimpressive, and that BT has been using prior year adjustments to achieve favourable growth figures, for example in page 24 of http://www.btplc.com/News/ResultsPDF/q307release.pdf . \nTake the quarter ended 30th September 2005, for example. At the time, BT said the external revenues of its Global Services division were \u00a31,740m. However, a year later, BT revised this figure downwards to \u00a31,703m. This enabled BT to claim growth of 3.5%, instead of the dismal 1.3% it would have been forced to announce if it hadn't adjusted the prior year's figures.\nBT has made a habit of adjusting the previous year's revenue figure every quarter. Only once in the past year has BT adjusted the figure upwards rather than downwards, and then it was by a tiny amount.\nBT does not provide a justification for these prior year adjustments in its quarterly reports, but there can be no doubt that it is using these adjustments to make anaemic growth figures look acceptable. It could be an opportune moment for City analysts to ask Lalani some searching questions."}

Officials claim that the project will have large-scale economic benefits, will reduce jet engine carbon emissions by 20 to 40 percent and will therefore offset the large growth in commercial air travel. The proposal comes at a time when European officials are under heavy criticism for not doing enough to reduce aircraft emissions.\nThe new proposal is outlined in a document that is reported to be likely to be passed by the European Commission. The document says that \"Not launching Clean Sky soon will put the European industry in a position of competitive disadvantage, with negative repercussions not only for the industry itself but also for the EU as a whole,\" and goes on to point out that the US has a comparable scheme, the National Aeronautics Research and Development Policy, and points out that progress is beginning to be made in the area by Brazil, Russia, and India. The paper also highlights the need for public spending in the scheme to ensure it does not fall behind international development. The commission has argued that \"the present value, at 2006 prices, of the cumulative direct effect over the period 2010-2035 of Clean Sky on economic output in the EU has been estimated to approximately \u20ac100 billion to \u20ac160 billion reflecting increased operating profits, labor expenditures, capital investment and other direct effects.\"\nThe proposal calls for the aviation industry to contribute \u20ac800 million between 2008 and 2014, with companies such as Airbus, Rolls-Royce, Saab, Thales, Dassault and Eurocopter. Universities and research institutions have also pledged support. The funding will be matched with public money from the EU, making the total cost \u20ac1.6 billion.\nAs well as approval by the European Commission, the plan requires approval by the individual EU member states. Britain, though infamously skeptical of large EU projects, has already voiced its support, along with several other countries.\nIf the project goes ahead, funding will be split between six separate main initiatives, including a \"greener\" engine, a \"smart\" fixed wing that continually readjusts itself to maintain best fuel economy, and research regarding lighter materials that could be used to replace metals in aircraft bodies and components.\nAccording to current estimates, the 20 to 40 percent carbon emissions reduction will mean a reduction of two to three billion tons between 2015 and 2050, and the project will also reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by 40 to 60 percent in the same time frame, as well as causing a 50 percent reduction in \"perceived aircraft noise.\"\nSources.\n "}

It also detailed the cause of an accidental release of 204,000 gallons of anhydrous ammonia from a pipeline in an environmentally sensitive area, and released preliminary information involving two commercial aircraft coming within 30-50 of each other on a .\nPipeline explosion.\nIn the gas explosion disaster, the towing vessel Miss Megan, which was of specifications that did not require inspection by the , was being operated in the West Cote Blanche Bay oil field in Louisiana by Central Boat Rentals on behalf of Athena Construction on October 12, 2006. The Miss Megan was pushing barge IBR 234, which was tied along the starboard side of barge Athena 106, en route to a pile-driving location. Athena Construction did not require its crews to pin mooring spuds (vertical steel shafts extending through wells in the bottom of the boat and used for mooring) securely in place on its barges and consequently this had not been done. During the journey, the aft spud on the Athena 106 released from its fully raised position. The spud dropped into the water and struck a submerged, high-pressure natural gas pipeline. The resulting gas released ignited and created a fireball that engulfed the towing vessel and both barges. The master of the towing vessel and four barge workers were killed. The Miss Megan deckhand and one barge worker survived. One barge worker is officially listed as missing.\nThe NTSB blames Athena Construction for the disaster, citing in the final report that Athena Construction's manual contained no procedures mandating the use of the safety devices on the spud winch except during electrical work. It was found that if the Athena 106 crew had used the steel pins to secure the retracted spuds during their transit, a pin would have prevented the aft spud from accidentally deploying. Furthermore, the spud would have remained locked in its lifted position regardless of whether the winch brake mechanism, the spud's supporting cable, or a piece of connecting hardware had failed.\nThe NTSB also found that contributing to the accident was the failure of Central Boat Rentals to require, and the Miss Megan master to ensure, that the barge spuds were securely pinned before getting under way. The Board noted that investigators found no evidence that the Miss Megan master or deckhand checked whether the spuds had been properly secured before the tow began. While Central Boat Rentals had a health and safety manual and trained its crews, the written procedures did not specifically warn masters about the need to secure spuds or other barge equipment before navigating. The NTSB stated that the company's crew should have been trained to identify potential safety hazards on vessels under their control.\nNTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker said of the investigation's results, \"Having more rigorous requirements in place could have prevented this accident from occurring. Not only do these regulations need to be put in place but it is imperative that they are enforced and adhered to.\"\nThe NTSB has made a number of safety recommendations as a result of this accident and the subsequent investigation. Recommendations were made to Athena Construction and Central Boat Rentals to develop procedures and train the employees of its barges to use the securing pins to hold spuds safely in place before transiting from one site to another.\nThe most major of the other recommendations are:\nTo the Occupational Safety and Health Administration:\nTo the U. S. Coast Guard\nAnhydrous ammonia spill.\nThe NTSB also released the result of its investigation into an environmental disaster in Kansas on October 27, 2004 in which 204,000 gallons (4,858 barrels) of anhydrous ammonia was spilled from a ruptured pipeline in into an environmentally sensitive area. Chemicals from the pipeline entered a nearby stream and killed more than 25,000 fish, including some fish from threatened species.\nThe incident reached the scale that it did due to operator error after the initial rupture. The 8 5/8-inch diameter steel pipeline, which was operated by Enterprise Products Operating L.P., burst at 11:15 a.m. in an agricultural area about 6 miles east of Kingman, Kansas. A drop in pipeline pressure, indicating abnormal conditions or a possible compromise in pipeline integrity, set off alarms displayed on the computerized pipeline monitoring system. Shortly after the first alarm the pipeline controller, in an attempt to remedy the low pressure, increased the flow of anhydrous ammonia into the affected section of pipeline. A total of 33 minutes elapsed between the time when the first alarm indicated a problem with the pipeline and the initiation of a shutdown.\nIn its initial report to the \n "}

The case was initially filed in 2005. Crucially, Finland's wolf management plan will not be changed as a result of the decision.\nThe court said that the commission had not proved that Finland was issuing the licenses in a manner that threatened the survival of the country's wolf population, estimated at around 250, and Finland themselves claim the number of Finnish wolves has recently doubled.\nThe court ruled that despite two cases where Finland was found to be in the wrong, this did not amount to \"constant and general administrative practice amounting to a breach.\" Finland had issued the licenses on a preventative basis, but EU regulations state that there must be proof of damage or other danger which can only be solved by killing the animal(s) involved, and thus Finland was breaching the Habitats Directive.\nThe court ruled that both sides should pay their own legal costs as both had failed in at least one of their claims.\n\"The European Court of Justice ratifies the main lines of the wolf population management plan,\" the Finnish agriculture ministry said. \"When planning future wolf policy in Finland, the ministry will take note of the court of justices decision on the wolf and the grounds for it\".\nHowever, the ministry also said that it would still issue permits to prevent \"very significant loss or damage\" providing a survey no more than a year old showed that hunting could actually prevent this loss or damage.\n\"The crucial point of the decision is that the current system, based on hunting permits granted by the game management districts, is not contrary to the habitats directive,\" the ministry said in a statement.\n\"The game management districts can continue to grant permits to hunt wolf within the limits laid down by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.\""}

There were also concerns that the caterpillars might be accidentally transported out of the park on park user's vehicles to areas where the moths have as yet failed to establish themselves. Guthmiller also commented that related sanitation issues\" would also \"significantly detract from the quality park camping experience.\"\nAndrea Diss-Torrance, another gypsy moth coordinator for the DNR, said of the infestation: \"It's very severe - it's as severe as I have ever seen.\"\nThe closure, which will run until at least June 27, is thought to affect around 95 campground reservations at the site, which covers 255 acres. State officials have been attempting to arrange alternatives for campers at nearby parks, or, failing this being acceptable, are offering refunds. The park will be closed until after the caterpillars have completed pupation - the period in their life cycle in which they transform into moths.\nThe gypsy moth is a pest in the U.S., having been introduced in the 19th-century in a failed attempt to to try to breed a hardy variant of silkworm. The moths can strip the leaves off at least 250 different tree species, and as they lack natural predators in the U.S., cause significant damage. The moths often chew leaves but don't actually eat them, thus increasing the potential damage.\nAt Rocky Arbor, they have already stripped all the trees in some areas of the park. The caterpillars can kill trees directly, but more usually weaken them so that they are more susceptible to die from other causes, such as disease.\nSources.\n "}

The recall involved 1.5 million \"Thomas Wooden Railway\" vehicles and train sets sold at toy stores and various retailers across the U.S. from January 2005 through June 2007.\nA subsequent recall has been issued in the United Kingdom, where Thomas the Tank Engine was originated in the 1940s as a character in a children's story by the Reverend W.V. Awdry. Around 70,000 toys are involved in the U.K. recall, according to \"The Guardian\".\n\"RC2 has determined that the surface paints on the recalled products contain lead. Lead is toxic if ingested by young children and can cause adverse health effects,\" the Consumer Product Safety Commission said in a press release dated June 13. \"Consumers should take the recalled toys away from young children immediately and contact RC2 Corp. for a replacement toy,\" the commission said.\nThose \"adverse health effects\" could include brain and nerve damage, especially in young children, as well as blood and brain disorders. Severe lead poisoning causes vomiting, diarrhea, convulsions, anemia, loss of appetite, headaches and in particularly high doses, coma and death.\nIn an article on Monday, \"The New York Times\" reported that recalls have been issued for 24 different toys in the U.S. in the past year, and every one of them was made in China. According to the Toy Industry Association, toys made in China account for around 70 percent to 80 percent of all the toys sold in the U.S., \"The Times\" said.\n\"These are items that children are supposed to be playing with,\" Prescott Carlson was quoted as saying by \"The Times\". Carlson is a co-founder of a child-safety website called Imperfect Parent, which tracks recalls of toys and other baby products. \"It should be at a point where companies in the United States that are importing these items are held liable,\" Carlson said.\nRC2 would not comment to \"The Times\", and a Consumer Product Safety Commission spokesman would not say how long ago the problem with the lead paint was discovered.\nFor a follow-up article on Tuesday, \"The Times\" visited a factory in Dongguan, in China's Guangdong province, where the \"Thomas and Friends\" toys are made. The paper interviewed workers and took photos on the factory floor.\n\"You're intruding,\" a factory manager identified only as Zhong was quoted as telling the reporters. \"Tell me, why exactly are you here?\"\nDuring the visit, a reporter, translator and a photographer were detained by factory officials, and released a day later after local police and government officials intervened.\nThe factory also produces other toys for RC2, including toy John Deere trucks, NASCAR racing models and M&amp;M's cars, \"The Times\" said. RC2 makes the toys under licenses from various companies. The \"Thomas and Friends\" toys are made under license from Hit Entertainment, which owns the \"Thomas\" brand.\nList of recalled Thomas and Friends toys.\nAccording to RC2, items in the \"Thomas and Friends\" recall are:\nToys listed that are marked with codes containing \"WJ\" or \"AZ\" are not included in the recall.\nEarlier, RC2 said that customers would have to cover shipping costs to return the toys to the company. It later agreed to cover postage after angry complaints by parents, \"The Times\" said in an article yesterday. Refunds will take about two months."}

The link exists in genetically susceptible individuals. \nThe study was lead by Alan Solomon, M.D., a professor and researcher at the University of Tennessee Graduate School of Medicine and the director of the Human Immunology and Cancer / Alzheimer's Disease and Amyloid-Related Disorders Research Program. Amyloidoses are a group of disease states caused by the deposition in vital organs of proteins in the form of fibrils, causing a range of symptoms such as swelling and kidney damage. The deposition of amyloid beta in the brain is central in the origin of the disease process of Alzheimer's disease. Foie gras is made from the livers of ducks or geese that have been force-fed.\nAccording to Solomon, \"we posit that this and perhaps other forms of amyloidosis may be transmissible, akin to the infectious nature of prion-related illnesses [such as mad cow disease]. In addition to foie gras, meat derived from sheep and seemingly healthy cattle may represent other dietary sources of [the fibrils]. People with a family history of Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis or other amyloid-associated diseases should avoid consuming foie gras and other foods that may be contaminated with fibrils,\" continued Solomon."}

The city's Ireland Park is dedicated to the Irish immigrants who fled the great famine to start a new life in Canada 160 years ago.\nMore than 1,200 people were present to watch McAleese disembark the Irish naval flagship \"L.E. Eithne\" to enter the park, after earlier having laid flowers at the St. James Cemetery which holds the remains of 281 immigrants.\nAccompanied by 45 dignitaries, security and naval officers, McAleese then walked around the perimeter of the park, admiring the monuments and pausing to enjoy the live music. \nMcAleese then cut the scarlet ribbon, opening the park to those gathered - including the likes of Toronto mayor David Miller, Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty, Irish ambassador Declan Kelly and federal Finance Minister Jim Flaherty. \nAfter the ceremony, the presidential entourage moved to the nearby stage to speak with the crowd, following the rendition of both the Canadian and Irish national anthems.\nFollowing her thanks to Canadians on Wednesday for helping to promote Ireland's economic improvements over the past fifteen years, McAleese also thanked the country for being \"a place of welcome for people around the world\", noting that \"the amazing Toronto welcome hasn't changed in 160 years\".\nBut the speech was not simply about past history, as McAleese drew a parallel between modern refugees and those fleeing Ireland's famine in the mid-19th century, speaking of a \"moral obligation to those around the world who continue to starve\".\nThe speech left an impression on the crowd, including 4th-generation Irishman Arn Bailey. \"It was really rather impressive\", explained Bailey - rueing the fact that he was unable to decipher the opening Gailge phrase that McAleese spoke to the gathering.\nMayor David Miller also took his turn at public speaking, reminding those gathered that \"we are all immigrants to this place, and that is what makes us Torontonians\"\nThe brainchild of brothers Robert and Jonathan Kearns, the park was built at a cost of $3.5 million dollars over the past seven years. The governments of both Canada and Ireland pledged matching $500,000 donations to help allay the cost, with the rest coming from donors and fundraisings.\n\"The Irish community of Toronto came forward with unprecedented generosity\", explained park founder Robert Kearns, blessing their ancestors for having \"stamped into the mold of this nation, the hallmark of...determination\".\nThe park's main feature, a towering monument bearing the names of hundreds of immigrants who died on Toronto's wharves, is made of irregular limestone shipped from a 200-year old quarry in Kilkenny, Ireland. Interactive outdoor computer terminals rest in the shadow of an illuminated glass tower, which will remain lit at night as a beacon.\nThe eastern edge of the 300'x70' park is bordered by five bronze statues of destitute refugees, created by Irish sculptor Rowan Gillespie in Dublin, and shipped to Toronto in February at a total cost of $325,000. The statues were made to complement a set of seven similar statues built on the coast of Ireland in 1997, to symbolise the emigrants \"leaving\" the island.\nApproximately 38,000 Irish refugees landed in Toronto after their stay at Grosse Ile, more than doubling the city's population in a mere six months. While more than 1,100 died shortly after arriving in the city, McAleeese noted that at least they \"had the comfort of knowing that they died [in Toronto], among love\".\nToday, there are nearly four million Irish-Canadians, a population rivaling that of the Emerald Isle itself.\nThe park is located along the Toronto Harbourfront, on a section of road renamed \"\u00c9ireann Quay\" in honour of the park in a ceremony last month."}

After 20 years of cross-breeding, researcher Songpol Somsri has come up with a durian \"that smells as inoffensive as a ,\" according to an article today by \"\".\n\"I've got friends from Australia, Europe and Japan who just won't eat durian because they can't stand the smell,\" Songpol was quoted as saying. \"But I'm sure producing those with a mild smell will help us find new markets.\"\nDespite their popularity, the fruits are banned from the subway system in Singapore. In , taxi drivers will often balk at a passenger with durian. The region's airlines won't allow them to be brought onboard. Across southeast Asia, a sign that denotes a finer hotel is a placard in the lobby with a red circle and cross through a silhouette of a durian.\nCultivated across all of southeast Asia, the fruit measures about 12 inches (30 centimeters) long and 6 inches (15 centimeters) in diameter, and weighs around 2 to 7 pounds (1 to 3 kilograms). The fruits are green on the outside, and covered with a thick, spike-covered husk. In , the name durian literally means \"thorny fruit\".\nInside is a yellow, custard-like flesh that has been described as nutty and sweet, perhaps like a fine French cheese. But because of the smell, which can be overpowering, durian is an acquired taste.\n\"The Guardian\" quoted a travel writer who described the smell like \"pigshit, turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\"\nDevotees of the \"king of fruits\" say a major part of the experience of eating the smelly fruit is the aroma, or fragrance, if you will.\n\"To anyone who doesn't like durian, it smells like a bunch of dead cats,\" Bob Halliday, a food writer in Bangkok was quoted as saying by \"The New York Times\" in April. \"But as you get to appreciate durian, the smell is not offensive at all. It's attractive. It makes you drool like a mastiff.\"\nSwanzea Banchee, manager of Sunshine Fruit, a major Thai exporter of durian, told (NPR) last month that he thinks an odorless variety of durian would help increase orders from overseas. But, he said he'd never eat one, adding that if a durian doesn't smell, then it isn't really a durian.\n\"I don't think it's possible to make a durian that doesn't smell,\" orchardist Somchai Tadchang was quoted as saying by \"The Times\". \n\"Anyway, durians actually smell good,\" he told \"The Times\". \"Only rotten durians stink.\"\nBut Dr. Songpol, senior agricultural scientist for the Thai government's Department of Agriculture, has put a lot of time and effort into creating his varieties of odorless durian, called Chanthaburi No. 1 and Chanthaburi No. 2. They were developed at the department's Horticultural Research Institute in , in , near the border with Cambodia, about 200 miles (320 kilometers) from Bangkok. Growing up on a durian farm, he has studied them all his life, he said.\nThe research farm has several thousand durian trees, and Songpol has spent about 20 years crossing more than 90 different varieties to produce Chantaburi No. 1. It started with only one tree, planted 18 years ago, and which produces about a dozen fruit annually, Songpol told NPR.\nSongpol has also been working on another variety of durian, without either the smell or the spikes. It's called Chanthaburi No. 3, he said.\nThe Thai government is keen to produce and export odor- and spike-free durian, announcing a plan back in April to distribute saplings of the three new varieties to farmers. It's expected that the odorless durians will hit the market in around three years."}

The shuttle is currently on STS-117, a mission to the International Space Station.\nAccording to NASA, there were showers within a 34-mile radius of the landing strip and clouds within 8,000 feet. Both of these represent conditions in which flight rules prohibit a landing. The shuttle has five more opportunities to land over the course of the next three days. \"Atlantis\" could land tomorrow at 2:16 p.m. or 3:51 p.m. ET.

If required, these alternative facilities will be activated on Saturday. \"Atlantis\" can potentially remain in orbit until Sunday, but officials have stated they will only postpone landing until Sunday if there are technical problems that require attention prior to landing.\nNASA would prefer not to use alternative sites as this would significantly increase the cost of preparing \"Atlantis\" for its next mission, scheduled for December. The shuttle would have to be brought back on a jumbo jet; this would take up to ten days and cost US$1.7 million.\nThe mission managers held a last-minute meeting late Wednesday to discuss potential problems which could affect the landing \u2013 damage to the thermal blanket on takeoff - which required repairs. Material known as gap filler was found to be sticking out of a wing, and debris was found floating nearby after the shuttle docked with the space station on Tuesday.

We spoke via e-mail and the questions asked were around the monarchy in New Zealand, following on from the previous Wikinews interview with Lewis Holden.\nThe Governor-General (currently being served by Hon. Anand Satyanand) is served by a person of integrity and long standing, free of political allegiance. They represent the Sovereign in right of New Zealand, a unitary country without an entrenched constitution.\nA decade ago, Cox joined the Monarchist League of New Zealand Inc. when it was founded. The League was formed to help prevent a republic from replacing New Zealand's current form of Government and remove the Queen of New Zealand as the de-jure head of state.\nCox believes that a monarchy separates the ceremonial and the practical aspects of the government. He also says it helps prevent the public from losing confidence in the governmental system in New Zealand as a whole, regardless of any criticism politicians may receive. This is due to politicians not having absolute power, which is held by the head of the monarchy in Britain, and public servants and the military pledging their allegiance to a non-political figure.\n\"In this time of increasing globalisation it is also good to remember that we are already part of an international family of nations, sharing the Queen with Australia, Britain, Canada and so on.\"\nCox said that there aren't many reasons for New Zealand to become a republic. Citing one of the most commonly used examples, Cox said, \"New Zealand might become a republic if Australia chose to do so.\" Although he says that this is not a good way to go about it.\nCox says that New Zealand has a significant international profile, much bigger than the size of New Zealand would suggest and a republican isn't needed to enforce this. Holden said in his Wikinews interview that being a monarchy is a cause of international confusion about New Zealand. Cox says that a move to a republican would suggest internationally that we are unsettled. Canada uses the monarchy to help promote its own identity, saying that New Zealand could follow this example. And says that in no way can a Monarchy limit our independence.\nIf New Zealand was to become a republic, Cox believes that in some circumstances there would be raised political and social tension, as well as tension between the Government and Maori. \"...that the Treaty of Waitangi was a compact between Queen Victoria and the Maori chiefs is of crucial importance.\"\nDespite republicans wishing to change, Cox believes that none of them would be dissatisfied with the service the Queen has given New Zealand, but show more dislike towards the British origins of the monarchy.\nNew Zealand's government becoming a republic would raise questions over whether or not the Treaty of Waitangi (Tiriti o Waitangi), a treaty between Maori chiefs and the Crown (signed by Queen Victoria), should be \"scrapped altogether\" despite it still being valid under law. \"The legitimacy of government in this country - if not its legality - depends on a compact signed in 1840.\" Cox doubts that there would be any attempt to change the Treaty, saying that it would require a very brave politician. \"The Treaty is what makes New Zealand unique, and the monarchy is an essential element of the Treaty. We should not assume that the emotional attachment to the Treaty is something that can be legislated away.\"\nAnd finally, further distancing himself from Lewis Holden, Noel Cox is a Ford fan, despite driving a BMW."}

The airline had begun regularly scheduled Siem Reap-Sihanoukville flights in January, providing a direct link between the two popular tourist towns.\n\"We cannot find the plane right now, so we cannot say anything,\" an unnamed PMT official was quoted saying by AFP.\nThe airline's website lists its current fleet as having two jets, a Boeing 737-200 and a McDonnell Douglas MD-83, and four prop-driven planes: two each of the Russian-made Antonov AN-24s and AN-12s.\nThe airline has a checkered safety reputation. In 2005, a piece of landing gear snapped off an aging Antonov AN-24 on landing at Banlung, Ratanakiri, with 59 passengers aboard. There were no injuries, but the airline was temporarily grounded after the incident."}

Although she was a legal resident at the time, she was not a citizen and voting is therefore illegal. \nMeyer, who was brought from Cuba to the US as a one-year-old child, says she believed she was a true American citizen all her life. \nMeyer said, \"I've been voting since I was 18. I didn't know I was here illegally. It was a mistake on my parents' behalf. They messed up. They didn't want to. It just \nhappened.\"\n\"This whole process is not my fault. They ask, 'How can you not know you're not a citizen?' But if you're parents don't tell you this, you don't know. It's like kids who don't find out until they're adults that they were adopted. We believe what we are told.\" \nLori Haley, a spokesperson for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said: \"She can plead her case before an immigration judge, if she feels that she has reason to seek release for removal. ...Everybody has due process when they're arrested.\"\nEarlier in 2004, Meyer won the election to City Council of the town of Adelanto, California, which has a population of about 23,000 people. Following this, police were tipped off that Meyer was born in Cuba, not in the US, leading to an investigation. The police later arrived and informed Meyer of her legal residency, but lack of US citizenship. After acknowledging this, she applied for citizenship. \nShe voted in the 2004 election, without having been granted citizenship. She was charged with fraudulent voting, a misdemeanor and a deportable offense. \nSo, on June 18, officials arrived at her home and told her to go to their office in San Bernadino. After being driven to the office by her husband a few days later, she was handcuffed, frisked, processed, and put in jail. \nZoila also commented on her case, saying that \"I see people writing 'this is my country.'

All 259 passengers and crew of the Boeing 747, and eleven people on the ground, were killed when a bomb destroyed the aircraft over the town of Lockerbie in Scotland. Megrahi was convicted on 270 counts of murder, and was sentenced to life imprisonment. It is expected that the SCCRC will refer Megrahi's case back to the court of appeal. A summary of the Commission's findings will be published, but the main report will not.\nToday's \"Scotsman\" reported that documents leaked from Megrahi's legal team include allegations that evidence used to convict him 'was subject to deliberate destruction and manipulation for political reasons'. Officials in both the United States and the United Kingdom are accused of \"a co-ordinated effort to mislead the court\" in order to divert attention from other suspects with links to Iran or Syria, whose support was needed at the time of the first Gulf War.\nDuring its three-year review, the SCCRC has been shown hundreds of documents and photographs which are alleged to show that evidence was invented, manipulated or ignored by the British police on the one hand and the CIA and FBI on the other. Veteran politician Tam Dalyell, who has campaigned against the conviction for years, has now said that the full report by the SCCRC should be made public, adding \"The Crown Office has a moral obligation to hold a public inquiry. If it embarrasses the Scottish judiciary, so be it. We're in danger of becoming the laughing stock of Europe.\" He also said \u201cI have no doubt that evidence was planted, and I have said so repeatedly in the Commons. Only a full, public and nonadversarial inquiry can finally settle this matter.\u201d Meanwhile, defence lawyers said that if Megrahi is granted an appeal or retrial they will attempt to convince authorities to release him until the case comes to court.\nThe credibility of several key parts of the prosecution's case is seriously questioned in the evidence submitted to the SCCRC, with rescue workers describing items as intact when they were discovered, but which were presented in fragmentary form at the Lockerbie bombing trial. The evidence of Maltese shopkeeper Tony Gauci is also challenged. Although Gauci testified that Megrahi bought clothes from him that were later found to have been in the suitcase containing the bomb, in reality he apparently gave a number of inconsistent and substantially different accounts of who bought the clothes, failed to pick out Megrahi at an identity parade, and even linked the clothes' purchase to convicted Egyptian terrorist Mohammed Abu Talb, from the Iran-backed Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Defence lawyers also alleged that two early statements by Gauci are missing altogether.\nOne investigator also claims that evidence was fabricated, while there was insufficient investigation into claims by a baggage handler at Heathrow International Airport that the suitcase containing the bomb was only added to the flight at the last minute.\nThe SCCRC refused to comment, saying: \"It is not for Scottish ministers to comment or preempt the outcome of this review.\" Further it said: \"It is the strong view of the Scottish Government that due process of law will be followed and seen to be followed in all matters pertaining to this case.\" \nThe SCCRC will issue it's report on Thursday June 28, 2007."}

Until this morning, the rain continued to pour and the hills are very slippery as well as densely forested,\" Keo Sivorn continued.\nThick clouds made visibility poor for the helicopter-borne rescue crews looking for the site. The search is centered in the D\u00e2mrei Mountains of Kampot Province, about 150 kilometers south of the capital, Phnom Penh.\nRadar contact with the Russian-made Antonov An-24 was lost at around 10:40 a.m. local time (0340 GMT) yesterday. The flight had departed at around 10 a.m. from Angkor International Airport in Siem Reap, near the popular Angkor Wat temple complex, and was heading to Sihanoukville International Airport at Sihanoukville, a beach resort town on the Gulf of Thailand. The plane was about 50 kilometers from its destination when it was lost.\nAround 1,000 people are combing the heavily forested mountains, Ly Thuch, deputy director of the National Disaster Committee, told Agence France Presse. \"We hope to find them soon. The [rescuers] will search deeper into the forest,\" Ly Thuch was quoted as saying.\nRescue efforts have been further hindered by uncertainty of the exact location of the crash, with some reports saying the plane had actually gone down in the Sihanoukville municipality, west of Kampot. So far, rescuers have had only vague eyewitness accounts from local villagers, Ly Thuch said.\nPrime Minister Hun Sen offered US$5,000 to the person who finds the plane.\n\"Our hope of finding survivors is slim,\" he said, according to Reuters. \"I am appealing to all, including farmers, who can help us locate the plane, and offering a reward of $5,000 in hard cash.\"\nThe flight had 16 passengers \u2013 13 South Koreans and three Czechs, plus a flight crew of a Russian pilot and five Cambodians. The South Korean embassy in Cambodia said all 13 of its citizens were tourists.\nPMTair is a small Cambodian airline with domestic and international routes, including direct flights from Seoul to Siem Reap, feeding a large influx of tourists from South Korea in the past few years. Last year, around 250,000 South Koreans visited the country. The airline had begun regularly scheduled Siem Reap-Sihanoukville flights in January, providing a direct link between the two popular tourist towns.\nThe airline has a checkered safety reputation. In 2005, a piece of landing gear snapped off an aging Antonov AN-24 on landing at Banlung, Ratanakiri, overcrowded with 59 passengers aboard. There were no injuries, but the airline was temporarily grounded after the incident. In another incident, a plane had to return to the airport after takeoff because of engine failure.\nYesterday's crash is Cambodia's first major aviation accident in nearly ten years. In September 1997, a Vietnam Airlines Tupolev Tu-134 crashed while trying to land in heavy rain at Phnom Penh International Airport, killing 65 of 66 people aboard. The sole survivor was a toddler."}

Bass also informed the local authorities in Atlanta about the unusual edits, but it is not known if the edits were investigated by the police. The second edit was made by a computer in Australia from a wireless network.\n\"It didn't become apparent until someone put the pieces together and realized that the comment was made by someone who apparently knew about the murders,\" added Bass.\nFayette County Sheriff deputy Lt. Tommy Pope stated that police found the family at about 2:30 p.m. ET, which is 18:30 UTC, on Monday when the WWE called police and asked them to do a \"welfare check\" after employees of WWE received calls and text messages from Chris Benoit. Early Sunday, Benoit sent repeated text messages that read \"My physical address is 130 Green Meadow Lane, Fayetteville Georgia. 30215.\" Another text message reportedly said \"The dogs are in the enclosed pool area.

The stories he told were mostly about his wife and son being sick with food poisoning and vomiting. Although, in one call he said that he and Nancy were at the hospital to be with Daniel who was hospitalized. Throughout he insisted that he would attend that live event in Houston.\nWhen he missed the live event on Sunday, and the WWE couldn't get hold of him, they contacted authorities. Police say that Benoit strangled his wife on Friday, smothered his son on late Friday or early Saturday, and then hanged himself inside his weight room on Sunday or Monday.\nThe Wikinews investigation is unable to conclude whether the anonymous editors had inside information about the death of Nancy Benoit.\nThis is not the first time Benoit's article has been edited to show false or unsourced information, as the article's edit history indicates a long history of promotional spam and vandalism. Around the time of the edits, the article contained a hidden warning to editors of the section mentioned, warning against adding rumours and speculations.

The companies that were grounded pending either improvements or licence revokation are Germania Trisila Air, Atlas Delta Setia, Survey Udara Penas, Kura-kura Aviation and SMAC, all of which also operate only aircraft with under-30 passenger capacities. They have three months to improve, or their licences will be revoked.\nJatayu had already ceased operations in August, but had intended to restart with a 150-seat Boeing 737. The licence was revoked because the state requires at least two aircraft to be commercially operated and because of the fact that it \"was lacking in pilots and human resources\". Also, the age of the jetliner meant that it would require a test called a 'C-Check' before it could begin commercial services, at a cost of $120,000.\nThe action comes as the result of a number of air crashes, namely the Adam Air Flight 574 disaster in which 102 people were killed, and the Adam Air Flight 172 accident, in which a plane snapped in half during a hard landing, but managed to hold together, thus preventing any serious injuries. As a result, all 54 of Indonesia's airlines were given a safety rating, with a level-1 rating meaning no action was needed, a level-2 rating meaning the airline needed to make some improvements, and a level-3 rating requiring that the airline be shut down unless improvements were made within three months. Most airlines received a level-2 rating, while none received the top rating. Adam Air was among the airlines to receive the level-3 rating, but was upgraded to tier 2 at the same time as the groundings.\nMeanwhile, state-owned Garuda Indonesia is now the only airline to have a type-1 rating, despite the fatal crash of Garuda Indonesia Flight 200 in March. According to the Indonesian Transport Ministry's Director General for Aviation Budi Mulyawan Suyitno, Garuda now satisfied 84 percent of civil aviation standards.\nThe ratings have been based on such criteria as surveillance, ramp checks, personnel, department safety, number of accidents and number of serious incidents, according to the BBC.

She is the widow of Lyndon B. Johnson, President of the United States from 1963 to 1969. She is best known for her conservation and beautification efforts involving wildflowers and roadsides.\nAs President Johnson and his wife, Lady Bird Johnson, criss-crossed States by road during the 1964 presidential campaign, she informed her husband of her feelings about the roadside junkyards they saw along the way. Inspired by her comments and enthusiasm from audiences, he observed \"If it's beautifying they want, it's beautifying they'll get.\" Recognizing that \"ours is an automobile society,\" the President did not want to curtail roads. He wanted to make roads the \"highways to the enjoyment of nature and beauty.\" Lady Bird thought that her love of seeing Texas highways in spring had influenced her husband. She enjoyed the results of Texan wildflower conservation programs which began in the 1930s.\nOne of the most prominent results of the President's beauty initiative was the Highway Beautification Act of 1965. It created restrictions on billboards and junkyards. As expected, it had been controversial. When the House considered its version of the bill on October 7, the debate lasted into the early morning hours of October 8. A pointed but tongue-in-cheek amendment by Representative Robert Dole (R-Kan.) to strike out the term \"Secretary of Commerce\" wherever it appeared in the bill and insert the words \"Lady Bird\" lost by a voice vote. Saying, \"Beauty belongs to all the people,\" the President signed the bill and gave the first pen to Lady Bird, along with a kiss on the cheek.\nIn 1982, she founded the National Wildflower Research Center to continue the mission of changing public attitudes toward native plants. In 1997 it was renamed the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center."}

Detainees, the ICRC said, were being forced to work on government projects or act as porters for the military.\nThe statement comes amidst other developments in Myanmar, where 51 detainees who were arrested in a crackdown on democracy demonstrations last month were released on Wednesday. \nIn Beijing yesterday, officials held talks with representatives of Myanmar's military regime, with the U.S. issuing a \"very pointed and very direct\" demand that the release detained democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi.\nICRC President Jakob Kellenberger said in a press release: \"Despite repeated entreaties by the ICRC, the [Myanmar] authorities have consistently refused to enter into a serious discussion of these abuses with a view to putting a stop to them.\"\n\"The continuing deadlock with the authorities has led the ICRC to take the exceptional step of making its concerns public,\" Kellenberger continued. \"The organization uses confidential and bilateral dialog as its preferred means of achieving results.

They are the latest additions to the already extensive List of air carriers banned in the EU. The ban is scheduled to come into effect on July 6. Just hours after the ban a Boeing 737 operated by one of the blacklisted airlines, TAAG Angola Airlines, crashed into a house during landing, causing at least six fatalities in Northern Angola.\nIndonesia currently has 51 airlines, having grounded several and revoked the licences of others on June 25. The EU said that substandard maintenance and operation and a slow reaction by Indonesia to solve the problem were the main causes of the ban. EU holidaymakers who have booked flights with banned airlines via travel agents will be refunded for the services. \nEU transport commissioner Jacques Barrot said of the ban \"Once more, the EU blacklist will prove to be an essential tool not only to prevent unsafe airlines from flying to Europe and to inform passengers travelling worldwide, but also to make sure that airlines and civil aviation authorities take appropriate actions to improve safety.\"\nOperations and safety editor at \"Flight International\" David Learmount commented that Indonesia, whose airline industry was deregulated the early 1990s, is one of a handful of cases where deregulation has lowered safety standards instead of improving them, saying of the move by the EU \"Standards in aviation safety have been going up dramatically on a worldwide basis, but there are still places where they are [of the standards of] the 70s and 80s. In Indonesia the safety watchdog was told earlier this year to pull its socks up, but the EU is clearly convinced that it has not done so.\" \nOne unnamed EU official was reported by \"The Guardian\" to have described Indonesia's civil aviation authority as \"not very reliable\", referring to a lack of reaction to warnings of an imminent ban and requests that Indonesia reassured officials that the problem was being dealt with. \nIndonesia has responded to the ban by saying that, according to information unseen by the EU, Indonesian safety standards are rising. Director-general of civil aviation at the Indonesian transport ministry Budhi Mulyawan Suyitno told \"Reuters\" new agency that, \"Our data can show them that we have improved on every line. The US had already downgraded Indonesia's safety rating earlier this year.\nAlso affected by the bans are Ukraine's Volare Aviation, while Russia has imposed bans on four of its airlines after consulting the EU and restricted six others, Bulgaria has revoked the licences of six cargo airlines and Moldova has banned eight airlines.\nMeanwhile, Pakistan International Airlines, subject of a controversial EU ban earlier this year, had restrictions on some of its aircraft lifted. The airline's fleet of Boeing 777s and some of their Boeing 747s and Airbus 310s will now be allowed back into European airspace.\nThe announcements come after three accidents involving Indonesian airliners - the New Year's Day crash of Adam Air Flight 574, which killed 102 people, the subsequent accident involving Adam Air Flight 172, which cracked in half on a hard landing but held together, preventing serious injury, and the March crash of state-run Garuda Indonesia Flight 200, which claimed 23 lives.

Seven known casualties, including the Asian male have been taken to the Royal Alexandra Hospital, Paisley.\nWhile the suspect was being treated in the hospital, a suspect device was discovered in the hospital, resulting in the partial evacuation of the building while the device was moved to a safe area. This object later turned out to be mundane, although initial reports believed it to be a suicide belt.\nThe BBC announced that the Prime Minister is being kept fully informed.

The second bomber, who was taken to the Royal Alexandria hospital in Paisley, is listed in critical condition tonight, and is being kept under 24-hour guard.\n2,300 passengers who were due to set off from Glasgow Airport today have been driven by coach to a conference centre, where a reception area has been set up for them.\nTwo people were arrested by The Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch on the M6 motorway in Cheshire in connection with the Glasgow International Airport attack and attempted London car bombings.\nThe Prime Minister Gordon Brown is expected to hold another COBRA meeting with other members of the Cabinet today.

A heavily redacted version of the once secret manual was released under the Freedom of Information Act.\nThe non-redacted parts of the manual detail strategies designed to suppress demonstrations and bar those identifiably opposed to Bush Administration policy access to presidential events.\nThe manual advises local Republicans, who are charged with filling such events, to form 'Rally Squads' from \"college/young republican organizations, local athletic teams, and fraternities/sororities\". A section titled \"Preventing Demonstrators\" (sic) directs: \"The rally squad's task is to use their signs and banners as shields between the demonstrators and the main press platform. If the demonstrators are yelling, rally squads can begin and lead supportive chants to drown out the protesters (USA! USA! USA!) As a last resort, security should remove the protesters from the event site.\" Another part urges: \"It is important to have your volunteers at a checkpoint before the [Metal Detectors] in order to stop a demonstrator from getting into the event.\"\nChris Hansen a senior ACLU attorney and lead counsel for the case remarked \"The White House has gone too far in its attempt to make dissent invisible,\" \"When taxpayers foot the bill for a public event, the president does not have the right to use a partisan litmus test to stack the audience with his political supporters.\"\nExternal links.\nPresidential Advance Manual ACLU, June 28, 2007"}

An early report by public safety officials claimed it was caused by a faulty power line or transformer. However, a later announcement by Moon Lake Electric Association CEO Grant Earl disputed this.\nBy Saturday morning, the fire had spread across approximately 46 square miles of land and been blamed for three fatalities: George Houston, his son Tracy Houston, and Roger Roberson, all from Farm Creek. Eleven year old Duane Houston, George's grandson, was able to escape the fire with only minor injuries.\nThe communities of Whiterocks, Farm Creek, Paradise and Tridell, consisting of approximately 500 local residents, were evacuated by Sunday, and at least five homes are known to have been destroyed. Those without family or friends to provide lodging have been relocated to the Ute Indian Tribe's auditorium in Fort Duchesne and Union High School in Roosevelt.\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency became involved in the management of fire fighting efforts on Sunday, and a specialized regional wildland fire team, the Rocky Mountain Type One Management Team, had begun to converge on the Uinta Basin to assist with the firefighting, along with about 100 members of the Utah National Guard.\nReports that same day claimed the fire was 5% contained, but that it had split into at least two separate smaller fires. Authorities declared their intention to prevent the fire from moving eastwards into Dry Fork Canyon and the town of Tridell."}

The money, to be channeled through UNICEF for its water and sanitation program, will be used to develop new wells and improve existing ones.\nUNICEF is to contribute a further \u20ac60,000, as well as technical expertise to the Ministry of Agriculture, who will carry out the bulk of the work.\n\u201cThe two-year water supply project targeting rural districts is very significant since people living in 45 villages and their 40,000 heads of cattle will have access to clean drinking water,\u201d said Joaquin Gonzalez, EU Representative in Djibouti.\nAt the same time, the UN aid agency World Food Program (WFP) indicated that it is working with the Ministry of Agriculture and UNICEF to gradually shift Djibouti's reliance on emergency aid to a Food for Work program, which it hopes will assist nomadic herders in Djibouti with long-term sustainability. \"What we are trying to do together with the Ministry of Agriculture and UNICEF is, for example to dig wells so that despite drought, these herders will be able to irrigate their fields,\" said Simon Pluess, WFP spokesman. \"And, together with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, we will try and promote vegetable gardens.\"\nDjibouti has survived harsh drought conditions for the past 5 years. Groundwater is the primary source of water for drinking and irrigation, but has been difficult to exploit and is often contaminated. Almost 50 percent of people in rural Djibouti do not have ready access to properly developed source of drinking water. And, due to the ongoing drought, water availability for livestock is limited. Livestock have shown signs of distress and, subsequently, milk production is down substantially. \nNearly half of all families in Djibouti's northwest were forced to migrate to find pasture for their livestock. As the droughts continue, the importance of properly maintained wells has become apparent. \u201cLife is harder and harder for us. Years ago there were more rains and also more pastureland for cattle. Now it is good for us to have functioning wells so that we can keep cattle here,\u201d said Anou Amada, farmer in the village of Andoli.\nA 2006 survey indicated that only 15 percent of wells in Djibouti were equipped with a protective concrete wall to prevent contamination. Andoli's well is one of many undergoing repair through WFP's Food for Work project.\n\u201cWFP couldn\u2019t do this alone, so we work with the Ministry of Agriculture and UNICEF to dig wells and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization for vegetable gardens,\u201d said Benoit Thiry, Director, WFP in Djibouti.\nWhen the project is completed in 2008, it will have increased Djibouti's water pump capacity by adding 25 solar-power pumps, which would compliment the current 61 diesel-powered pumps. \"The advantage of solar...is that it is much cheaper and requires less maintenance,\" said Omar Habib, UNICEF communication specialist. \"We want the people to participate and to appropriate these pumping stations. The government\u2019s role in the long term should be as restricted as possible,\" he added."}

Earlier, Hamas had captured several members of the Army of Islam and continued to put pressure, by threat of force, on the captors. An intervention by another militant group, the Popular Resistance Committees, led to a breakthrough in negotiations between Hamas and the Army of Islam.\nRallies were held worldwide and an online petition calling for Johnston's release was signed by over 200,000 people. On Johnston's appearance after his release a witness said that he appeared healthy, but had lost weight.\n\"We have been able to close this chapter which has harmed the image of our people greatly,\" said Khaled Meshaal, leader of Hamas. \"The efforts by Hamas have produced the freedom of Alan Johnston.\" \nOn the subject of Fatah, Meshaal told Reuters, \"It showed the difference between the era in which a group used to encourage and commit security anarchy and chaos and the current situation in which Hamas is seeking to stabilise security.\" Hamas had stated that they were anxious to have Johnston freed to highlight differences in their ability to provide security in Gaza as compared to Fatah.\nAlan Johnston was the only western correspondent working full-time in Gaza. He went missing on March 12th 2007. Concern for his safety grew last month as a video released by the Army of Islam showed Johnston wearing a vest packed with explosives.\nIn a press conference with Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniya, Alan Johnston said he felt 'buried alive and detached from the world' and that he gained hope through listening to the radio and the support that he has received from around the world. He also thanked the Hamas leader and security services.\nHis parents held a press conference just after 7 a.m. (BST) on the 4th of July. The parents said that they never gave up hope over the 114 days. They received a phone call late last night where he told them briefly that he was okay. The parents ended wanting to thank people for helping them get through this difficult time and for keeping their spirits up.\nGordon Brown Prime Minister of Britain issued a statement on the release of Alan Johnston at his first Prime Minister's Questions. \"I welcome the good news of Alan Johnston's release. This will come as a great relief to his family and friends, and all those who have worked to see him freed.\"\nAt 2:15 p.m. (BST) a rally was held at BBC Television Centre which over one hundred BBC staff attended. At the same time the 'Free Alan Johnston' poster which was attached to the side of the Television Centre was taken down. Alan Johnston also thanked the people at the rally and was amazed at the support he has been given."}

But as they observed Anthrocon 2006, their thoughts on furries changed.\n\"They're not afraid to be themselves,\" said Carter. \"When they left, the magic left.\"\n\"They were such a force,\" added Medica.\nInspired by their experience, they decided to write a play entitled \"Furry Tales\". It is the story of four friends: BlueWolf22, MisoKitty2, HuggyBunny and Gorillanator. They met online and agree to meet at a furry convention. As it turns out, BlueWolf22 is an imposter, sent by an online magazine called \"everythingawful.com\" (an obvious play on Something Awful, a site frowned on by the sub-culture for their coverage) in an effort to get some steamy content on the debauchery that supposedly permeates the furry fandom. However, BlueWolf's opinions change, and he discovers he is a peer to his new furry friends.\nWikipedia describes furry fandom as \"a fandom distinguished by its enjoyment of anthropomorphic, often humanoid, animal characters. Examples of anthropomorphism in the furry fandom include the attribution of human intelligence, facial expressions, and sometimes anatomy, speech, bipedalism, and the wearing of clothes.\"\nThe world's largest furry convention, Anthrocon takes place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania each July. Its focus is on furries: fictional anthropomorphized animal characters in art and literature.\nThe first staged reading of Furry Tales will occur on July 5, 2007, on the first day of festivities for Anthrocon 2007, at the CLO Cabaret. Medica and Carter planned it for July 5 in the hopes that furries attending Anthrocon will provide input for improving the final product. The Chairman of Anthrocon Dr. Samuel Conway has been invited to the reading, and he has confirmed plans to attend.\nTickets may be reserved online for $15 each plus a service charge of at least $7.50 from Pittsburgh Cultural District.\nIn related news, Anthrocon has selected local no-kill animal shelter Animal Friends as its 2007 charity. The shelter will benefit from the proceeds of Anthrocon's annual charity auction, which raised $5,845 for the Western Pennsylvania National Wild Animal Orphanage last year (the charity's total revenue was $8,400). Representatives of the charity will also be available as in the dealers room. \nSources.\n\"Originally published on WikiFur News, co-licensed under the GFDL and Creative Commons licenses.\""}

In a 48-page affidavit, Mahathir said Anwar was using the suit to \"rehabilitate himself for high office\".\n\"The plaintiff's action is unsustainable based on background evidence ... and the [Mahathir]'s application to strike out is therefore allowed with cost,\" High Court Judge Tengku Maimon Tuan Mat was quoted as saying by Agence France-Presse (AFP). \nNeither Anwar nor Mahathir were present for today's hearing.\n\"I have informed Anwar Ibrahim of the decision and he is indeed quite upset and he has instructed that we file an appeal as we are dissatisfied with the decision,\" Anwar's lawyer, Sankara Nair, was quoted as saying by AFP.\nAt a Malaysian Human Rights Commission conference in September 2005, Mahathir said he had to dismiss Anwar because having a homosexual in his Cabinet would have been immoral.\nMahathir's remarks stemmed from sodomy charges brought against Anwar in September 1998, which along with corruption charges, disgraced Anwar and sent him to prison for six years.\nAnwar has said the accusations were politically motivated to keep him from challenging Mahathir. \nThe sodomy conviction was later overturned after two appeals, but the corruption charges stood.\nJudge Tengku Maimon noted that, although the sodomy conviction was overturned, earlier court findings proved the charge that Anwar had sodomized his former family driver, Azizan Abu Bakar.\n\"Hence, given the background facts of the case ... it is apparent that the defenses are bound to succeed. No purpose would have been served in insisting that the defenses be proven at a full trial,\" Tengku Maimon was quoted as saying by Bernama.\nFrom the early 1990s, Anwar was being groomed by Mahathir, his former mentor, to take over as prime minister, but by the end of the decade, conflicting views on governance had deteriorated the \"father-son\" relationship.\nWith Anwar in jail, Mahathir retired in 2003 after 22 years in office, turning power over to Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi.\nAnwar was released from prison in 2004, having his sentence reduced by the successful overturning of the sodomy conviction. He is barred from seeking public office until 2008. Earlier this year, he sought to be named leader of Parti Keadilan Rakyat, the party of which his wife Dr. Wan Azizah is president, but was prevented from doing so because of the political ban.\nIn other recent legal cases, Anwar had proven victorious. In 2005, he won a judgment of $1.2 million against author Khalid Jafri, who had written a book that accused Anwar of fathering an illegitimate child. DNA tests proved the child was not his. Anwar also forced a public apology from a former police chief who had beat him in custody in 1998."}

Hovind filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals claiming he was prevented from challenging the amount of his tax liability. According to the Pensacola News Journal, \"the three-judge panel ruled that Hovind failed to raise the issue at the right time, so he waived his rights to contest his tax liability.\"\nOn July 7, 2006 in (Docket number 011894-05L) the United States Tax Court found that Hovind was deficient in paying his federal income taxes in tax years 1995-97 in the amount of $504,957.24. The Tax Court ruled that the IRS had a valid, perfected lien on Hovind's property in that amount. In the Memorandum Opinion the judge noted that Hovind's defense was based on \"bizarre arguments\" and \"some of which constitute tax protester arguments involving excise taxes and the alleged '100% voluntary' nature of the income tax.\"\nIn the November 2006 case Kent was convicted of 58 counts while Jo Hovind, his wife, was convicted of 44 counts, and both decided not to present a defense at trial. In January Hovind was sentenced to ten years plus fines and probation, and last Friday June 29, 2007, Jo Hovind was sentence to one year and one day plus probation and fines.\nThough the couple were indicted on the November charges last summer in July 2006, they had a long history of tax protesting, filing false bankruptcy claims, filing frivolous lawsuits, and running the Creation Science Evangelism Ministry (CSE) without proper licensing. In court the IRS noted Kent Hovind had never filed any income taxes with the agency.\nAccording to the Pensacola News Journal, in court last Friday Eric Hovind, the couple's son, said of his mother \"She did what she was told\" and she was \"a submissive wife.\" Jo spoke to the court saying, \"I had no intention of evading the IRS.\" She continued, \"I really did not have a leadership role in CSE\" and finished \"I would never knowingly do anything illegal.\" But the prosecutor said Jo Hovind's statement contradicted the evidence. \"I do not believe she's being truthful to the court,\" the prosecutor told the judge.\nAt the hearing the judge explained that while \"Mr. Hovind was the decision-making authority\" at CSE and Dinosaur Adventure Land in four years Jo Hovind cashed some 200 checks, all under $10,000, for a total of $1.5 million. The judge further noted, the frequent use of cash was \"their attempt to keep the ministry under the radar screen of the IRS\" and not provide a traceable record. In the end the judge concluded, \"Mrs. Hovind was in charge of the payroll,\" when handing down the sentence. \nThe judge said a sentence must be handed down so that it will \"promote respect for the law\" and deter others who might be tempted to break the law. Jo Hovind received a year and a day in prison, followed by three years probation upon release, and ordered her to pay $8,000 in fines and costs. Kent Hovind received ten years, followed by three years probation upon release, and ordered to pay over $600,000. \nThe Pensacola News Journal further added, \"the government also has taken 10 properties from the Hovinds\" for money owed."}

Salzburg, Austria, was eliminated in the first round by 25 votes.\nAccording to the Associated Press, several factors played a part in Sochi's win. One factor was that of Russian president Vladimir Putin himself. Putin, an avid skier and a black belt in , traveled to Guatemala to lobby IOC members and headed up the final presentation of Sochi's bid to the assembly. \n\"Putin being here was very important, he worked very hard at it. He was nice. He spoke French -- he never speaks French.

He was humble. He spoke in English and French. The second most powerful man in the world said everything will be delivered.\"\nJuan Antonio Samaranch, former IOC president and Spanish ambassador to Russia made a big push for Sochi, which may have swung some key votes according to some IOC members.\n\"This is, without doubt, not just a recognition of Russia's sporting achievements but it is, beyond any doubt, a judgment on our country, it is a recognition of our growing capability, first of all economically and socially,\" Putin stated upon his return to Russia. \nAnother factor is Russia's brand new wealth from exports of Russian natural gas and oil, which provided over $12 billion for Putin to invest in the Games and the infrastructure around Sochi.\nRussia last hosted the games in 1980 in Moscow, when the country was known as the Soviet Union. The games were boycotted by the United States and some of its allies over the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.\nThe United States continues to spar with Russia over human rights abuses and the subjugation of democratic freedoms.\nU.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack spoke in Washington to reporters stating, \"Well, it's a proud moment for Russia and I am sure it's a proud moment for him so he can characterize it as he sees fit, I'm not sure that the selection of Russia to host the Winter Olympics really, at this point, changes our view or others' views -- or concerns -- about the direction of democracy and related issues: human rights, respect for freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and to be able to peaceably organize opposition democratic parties.\"\nMeanwhile, Sochi has announced that progress of construction on venues in Sochi will be offered online. Dmitri Chernyshenko, Sochi 2014's bid leader said, \"The IOC will be online every single moment in terms of construction, there will be live video from all construction sites.\"\nThe next Olympic bid is for the 2016 Summer Olympics which includes bids from Chicago, Tokyo, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, Doha, Baku, and Prague."}

The state-run \"Xinhua\" news agency says the cause of the disaster is under investigation. Four people are reported to be in a serious condition.\nOriginally, \"Xinhua\" reported only five fatalities, but as rescue workers continued to move away debris, the full extent of the death toll was discovered. \"Xinhua\" has also reported that several employees at the bar, as well as the wife of the owner, were being questioned. According to a philly.com article authored by \"The Associated Press\", \"Xinhua\" failed to state whether this was as witnesses or as suspects in any potential criminal activity, but the \"Shanghai Daily\" said that \"Xinhua\" had reported the people had been detained as suspects. The owner himself, Mr. Qu, was killed in the blast.\nInvestigators say they are currently unsure if the blast was purely accidental, or if foul play was involved, as all efforts were initially focused on attempting to locate survivors. The two-storey building, which also housed a bathhouse, was completely leveled by the blast. In addition, several cars were buried under the debris and windows in nearby buildings were shattered by the pressure wave. A power cut in the area was also caused by the blast due to damage to the local electricity network.\n77-year-old local resident Chen Xiaohong, who lives 50 metres from ground zero, described the explosion: \"I was watching my grandson finishing his lessons. Suddenly, we heard a big bang, then the door burst open from effects of a powerful shock wave and the lights went out... We were lucky not to have been hurt.\" Meng Xianling, who runs a seafood stall located down a narrow lane opposite the site of the accident building, commented that \"I was afraid the parlor's boiler would explode. Mercifully, it didn't.\"\nChina has been the location of many disasters in both public and private places, such as fires and explosions. Earlier this year, an unsafe arrangement with a two-ton steel ladle resulted in the Qinghe Special Steel Corporation disaster, in which molten steel was accidentally poured into a room full of workers, killing 32. The majority of China's accidents stem from a combination of lax safety regulations and negligence, and accidents continue regularly despite promises by the government to prevent them.\nSources.\n "}

The police have had trouble locating the suggested town. \"They say I can bring my husband to swap with the baby,\" Oluchi Hill, Margaret's mother, told the \"BBC\". \"He wanted to go down for his baby but the police commander told him not to.\" Mrs. Hill was able to speak with her daughter during the phone call.\nThe kidnappers had issued a three-hour deadline for the swap. There has been no further communication from the kidnappers.\nThis event is the latest in a long line of kidnappings of expatriates with links to the Nigerian oil industry, following the abduction of five workers from a Nigerian oil rig. Reports state that Hill was taken from a car in which she was passenger. The British Foreign Office has confirmed the kidnapping and has called for the child's immediate release, whilst providing support for the family. The identity of the group that carried out the kidnapping is not known, with the main militant group, The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, denying involvement. In past cases of child kidnappings, which remain rare, the victims had been returned unharmed on payment of a ransom. Workers in the oil industry have been more commonly targeted for kidnapping. \nThe Niger Delta contains more than 90 percent of Nigeria's natural resources, yet many of the indigenous population remain in poverty. Militant groups claim to be aiming to improve conditions for the poor. The BBC reports that over 100 foreign nationals have been kidnapped so far this year. Since the start of 2006, over 200 such kidnappings have taken place, and 15 adults remain in the custody of armed groups in Nigeria.\nThe British Foreign Office advises against all travel to the Niger Delta."}

The hatch caused damage to around 300 metres of overhead line, causing Cityrail to cancel services between Wynyard and North Sydney stations.\nThe 30 passengers aboard the train were evacuated and placed onto buses shortly after 3:00 p.m. AEST. The Daily Telegraph reported that passengers feared electrocution, as it was uncertain whether or not the fallen lines had come into contact with the bridge. There were also fears for bridge climbers who were on top of the bridge.\nThe incident causes transport chaos, with bus services replacing trains, traffic congestion on the bridge and the refusal of taxis to carry passengers into the city.\nCommuters reported queues of up to one kilometre long in North Sydney waiting for buses and around 200 people waiting for buses at Wynyard. It is believed that passengers at Wynyard had to wait some 45 minutes before buses arrived.\nCommuters criticised the government over the way the incident was handled. Commuters said they felt as if nobody knew what was going on and Cityrail transit officers did not seem to be in control. The government responded with Transport Minister John Watkins saying that the government did the best it could under the circumstances.\nMr Watkins said that the government had arranged \"an extra 50 buses to run a shuttle service between North Sydney station and Wynard,\"\n\"But when you have a major problem like this, a major breakdown in our rail system, it is going to put pressure on our road system and on other public transport.\"\nTrain services were resumed at around 9:00 p.m. AEST between Wynyard and North Sydney, with Cityrail warning that delays should be expected."}

Samuel Dash expressed concern at the choice of Thompson, since the information was revealed in private sessions by another investigator prior to the public session.\nRegarding the leak, \"the Globe\" wrote, \"The view of Thompson as a Nixon mole is strikingly at odds with the former Tennessee senator's longtime image as an independent-minded prosecutor who helped bring down the president he admired.\"\nThompson has long been seen as a Washington \"insider\" who began his lobbying career in 1975. Lobbying accounts for approximately 80 percent of Thompson's total income and lobbying the federal government alone has earned him more than US$1 million. On behalf of one of his clients, the Tennessee Savings and Loan League, Thompson lobbied for the bill that deregulated the savings-and-loan industry. According to CNN, \"Experts say the final version of that bill played a large role in the savings-and-loan crisis of the late 1980s, opening the door to widespread fraud and mismanagement.\" Thompson most recently helped raise money for Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby's recent defense for perjury and obstruction of justice. Thompson held a fundraising party at his house for Libby."}

The samples, estimated to be 450,000-900,000 years old, have also shown that no more than one million years ago, Greenland was once home to forests and animal life.\n\"We have shown for the first time that southern Greenland, which is hidden under 2 km of ice, was once very different to the Greenland we see today. Back then, it was inhabited by a diverse array of conifer trees and insects,\" said Professor and leader of the team who made the discovery, at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, Eske Willerslev.\n\"This genetic material presents a biological environment which is completely different to today. We have found grain, pine, yew and alder. These correspond to the landscapes we find in eastern Canada and in Swedish forests today,\" added Willerslev.\nWillerslev also says that because of the presence of the yews, the temperatures in that area of Greenland could not have been \"lower than -17 degrees Celsius\" and that with the variety of other trees, the summer temperatures were no lower than \"10 degrees Celsius.\"\nThese findings could change the history of Greenland. The current theory is that Greenland was free from its ice no more than 125,000 years ago. The results of the findings now suggest that Greenland may have been covered with ice for at least 450,000 years."}

The program will take effect July 10, when the practice of issuing 90-day passes to people who present a valid driver\u2019s license, vehicle registration, and proof of insurance for the vehicle used for access ends. Those passes will be grandfathered out as they expire.\nThe RAPIDGate program for fast entry into Fort Lee replaces what was once access privileges performed by the installation itself, which came free of cost. The new outsourced program administered by Portland, Oregon-based Eid Passport, Inc. enhances security to the installation by performing background checks. Their service comes at a price. The screening process makes a ten-year felony background check, performs a check against terrorist and sexual offender watch lists, and does a social security cross reference to validate a person\u2019s identity.\nQualified applicants are issued a pass that enables them to bypass inspection pits and use any of the facility\u2019s seven gates for access. Businesses whose employees would benefit by this are required to contact the program provider and have \"point of contact\" persons who can validate an applicant's employment. Enrollment in the program costs the business US$199. A pass for each employee of the business costs $159 annually. The pass for employees expires after a year, when a new background check is required by the program. \nThe program is a voluntary alternative for civilians to conform with new access policies mandated by the Department of Defense and the U.S. Army, according to an information pamphlet distributed by the base. A kiosk will be set up at Fort Lee to accept applications that process a photograph, social security number, and fingerprint.\nThose without a RAPIDGate pass will need to enter the fort at locations where their vehicle can be inspected. A rigorous inspection involves armed guards asking the driver to place keys on the dash board, pop the hood and the trunk, open the glove box, and have all occupants exit the vehicle and open all doors, including the hood and trunk. While the vehicle is inspected inside, another guard uses a mirror attached to a wand to inspect under the chassis of the vehicle's undercarriage.\nEid Passport, Inc. specializes in identity authentication and background screening. Fort Lee will be the 12th military installation out of an estimated 250 military installations on U.S soil to implement identity screening as part of new policies mandated by the Department of Defense (DoD).\n\"The pass contains no personal information,\" said David Smith, the director of marketing for Eid Passport. It does contain a barcode which is scanned at entry. The RAPIDGate program database includes a biometric fingerprint that might be checked by the scanning device against the presenter of the pass in times of elevated security. The pass is also embedded with an active RFID transmitter. The pass is scanned on entry to the fort at the gate check point, but not upon exit. If the RFID transmitter works properly, movement into and out of the base will be recorded.\nThe Fort Lee pamphlet mentions a \"a new mandate\" by the DoD. That mention appears to be in reference to portion of the language found in an Instruction issued in October last year by the DoD that states, \"Implement a verification process, whether through background checks or other similar processes, that enables the U.S. Government to attest to the trustworthiness of DoD contractors and sub-contractors.\"\nThe Instruction stems from a Directive signed by President Bush in August of 2004. That Directive, from the Department of Homeland Security, says in part, \"Wide variations in the quality and security of forms of identification used to gain access to secure Federal and other facilities where there is potential for terrorist attacks need to be eliminated.\"\nFort Lewis in Washington state was the first U.S. military installation to adopt the RAPIDGate program as a test in 2004. Since then, Fort Sam Houston, Fort Carson, and Fort Bragg, among other installations have adopted the program. \n\"What happened at Fort Dix, [New Jersey], as we look at it, is a Fort Dix issue,\" Laura Arenschield reported spokesman for the 18th Airborne, Tom McCollum, as saying in June. \"That should not be taken as an invitation for someone to try it here at Fort Bragg, but (security) is a living, breathing entity. You have to constantly change it just to keep those who are trying to penetrate it on their toes.\" The new security measures will go into effect at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, which is among the largest of domestic military bases, starting July 8."}

A Wimbledon champion in 2000, 2001 and 2005, Williams was not the favorite to win the title again this year. Currently ranked 23rd in the world, she entered the tournament in the shadow of her sister, Serena Williams. \nAt the beginning of the tennis season, Serena stated her own determination to reclaim the No. 1 ranking. Serena showed better than Venus at the French Open by reaching the quarter finals, and won the Australian Open in January (Venus dropped out due to an injury). In spite of her initial strength, Serena's hopes to dominate the tournament were cut short when she lost to No. 1 seeded Justine Henin in the quarterfinals.\nBartoli, the eighteenth seed for this year's championships, had never progressed past the fourth round of any Grand Slam event. However, she progressed to the final by defeating third seed Jelena Jankovi\u0107 in the fourth round and Justine Henin in the semifinals in one of the major upsets of Wimbledon history.\nAs Henin lost to Bartoli in the semifinals, Venus Williams was poised to become the lowest seeded player in recorded history to win the Wimbledon singles title. With powerhouse serves and an aggressive ground strokes battle, she did just that. Williams comfortably knocked out Bartoli in two straight sets, with match point accidentally striking Bartoli in the wrist. \nVenus was reunited with the Venus Rosewater Dish on Centre Court during the trophy ceremony.

Senior vice-president of the New South Wales Teachers Federation, Bob Lipscombe, said that teachers are worried about the footage being used improperly, as well as the fact that both teachers and students would be filmed at work by the cameras.\nThe increase in security cameras being used in schools is an attempt to protect valuable schooling equipment from theft and damage, in particular computers in computer rooms. Lipscombe said that installations in computer rooms will potentially affect many teachers, as all subjects can be taught with the integration of technology.\nCCTV surveillance is preferred by some schools over fitting alarm systems and physical bars on entrances to the room, as it is cheaper to install.\nLipscombe said that the Teachers Federation isn't against CCTV systems provided they are operated properly and with appropriate consent. A solution proposed is to only have the surveillance system record during times when the room is unattended.\nA spokesperson for the New South Wales Department of Education and Training has said that the footage obtained is confidential and used to assist police in investigating criminal activity."}

Syria and Jordan have received the largest number of Iraqi and are having difficulty coping with the numbers. \nThe appeal was made by UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond at a press conference on Friday at the in , Switzerland. He criticized governments for earlier expressing concern and pledging support for the refugees but not following through on promises. \"Syria and Jordan have still received next to nothing in bilateral help from the world community,\" said Redmond.\nThere are an estimated 2 million Iraqi refugees total in Syria and Jordan with the numbers increasing daily. Each day, Syria receives approximately 2,000 Iraqis and, of those, about 1,000 will stay for an extended time. There are a further 2 million displaced Iraqis who move and settle in safer areas within Iraq.\nThe large numbers of refugees is putting pressure on the infrastructure of the host countries, resulting in difficult living conditions for the inhabitants. Ron Redmond acknowledges that some US$70 million in donations have been received by the UNHCR, and a further $10 million promised since the Iraq displacement conference in April, 2007. He points out, however, that much more is required. \"We stressed then and we say it again, donors must provide direct bilateral support to these host countries whose schools, hospitals, public services and infrastructure are seriously overstretched because of the presence of millions of Iraqis they have so generously welcomed,\" said Redmond.\nSchools are particularly difficult to set up and staff in a refugee situation. Syria has currently hundreds of thousands of Iraqi refugee children, but only has resources for 32,000 students. Syria offers free access to public schools for refugees, but doesn't have the infrastructure to cope. Some 14,000 Iraqi refugee children in Jordan attend school, out of the possible 250,000. The refugee children in Jordan don't have access to public schools and instead go to private schools. UNHCR is partnering with UNICEF to provide 150,000 classroom spots in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon, but the coordination of the required resources, such as buildings, teachers, and school supplies is proving difficult.\nHealth issues for the refugees is also a concern. UNHCR has set up three primary care medical facilities in Syria, with two more in the works. But approximately 10,000 Iraqis per month require a doctor's attention, 3,000 of which require serious medical treatment.\n\"It is unconscionable that generous host countries be left on their own to deal with such a huge crisis,\" said Ron Redmond at the press conference. \"We strongly urge governments to step forward now to support them in dealing with this situation and renew our call for international solidarity and burden sharing.\"\nThe president of , Ken Bacon, agrees that a more comprehensive approach to the situation is required and believes that it would be good investment for the United States to increase its aid to the region. \"The United States ought to be pumping money into Jordan and Syria,\" Bacon suggests. He feels that the sheer numbers of refugees can have a destabilizing influence in the Middle East. However, the complicated diplomatic relationship between the U.S. and Syria has resulted in slow progress, according to Bacon, as bilateral discussions have not taken place and the UN is forced to mediate.\nJordan and Syria impose restrictions on refugees.\nBoth Jordan and Syria have put in place new entry and residency conditions, which has resulted in thousands of refugees being stranded on Iraq's borders. Families have been separated based on a person's age and type of passport held. Jordan and Syria have not signed on to the UN .\nThe non-governmental organization has been critical of Jordan and Syria on their policy of returning refugees, saying they \"are violating on a daily basis the most fundamental principle of refugee protection \u2013 , which prohibits the return of refugees to persecution or serious harm.\"\nTo gain access to Jordan, Iraqi refugees must be over 40 or under 20, and must prove they have sufficient funds to support themselves in the country. They must also be in possession of a new generation passport.\nNasser Hikmat Jaafar drove 900 km from with his family to reach Jordan in mid-June, 2007. Half of his family was refused entry to Jordan. \"They allowed entry just for my wife and two daughters and denied me and my three sons. They didn't tell us the reasons, but just said they are fed up with men of such ages [between 20 and 40 years old],\" said Jaafar. He changed plans and traveled with all his family to the Syrian border, a distance of approximately 500 km from Iraq's Jordanian border.\nSyria has less restrictions on gaining entry, but has imposed residency conditions. Refugees can only stay up to three months and must then leave Syria and re-enter to be eligible to stay for another period.\nUnited States Government resettlement program.\nThe United States government has a program set up for Iraqi asylum seekers in Jordan who meet specific criteria. If they meet the requirements, listed below, they may be eligible for resettlement under the (USRAP).\nInterested asylum seekers are encouraged to apply directly with the U.S. Overseas Processing Entity (OPE) in , Jordan, which is operated by the (IOM). Individual Iraqis and their immediate family that meet one of the conditions below may seek access through the direct program:\nAccording to the U.S. government information on the process, those individuals initiating a case with the OPE will not be guaranteed an interview for resettlement in the United States. Applicants would be screened for eligibility as per the requirements listed above and are subject to approval. \nIn a February 14, 2007 press briefing, U.S. addressed the Iraq refugee crisis. \"Our key immediate objectives are to assist internally displaced Iraqis and Iraqi refugees by building up the capacities of UN agencies and NGOs,\" said Dobriansky. \"This includes increasing opportunities for permanent resettlement for the most vulnerable Iraqis, to establish specialized programs to assist Iraqis who are at risk because of their employment or close association with the United States Government, to work diplomatically with regional governments through bilateral and multilateral channels to uphold the principle of first asylum,\" she continued.\nIn the February press briefing, the U.S. committed to receive 7,000 Iraqi refugees by fiscal year end, September 30, but clarified that perhaps only half that number would be \"travel-ready\" subsequent to the interview process as described above. The U.S. could accommodate 20,000 to 30,000 Iraqi refugees per year without difficulty, according to Ken Bacon of Refugees International.\nTo date, the U.S. has allowed 750 Iraqi refugees into the country."}

Sunday was chosen as its date matches the aircraft's designation number when written in the American format, 7/8/07.\nThe event was attended by 15,000 people including employees, customers, suppliers and officials from government and the local community. \nScott Carson, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes said, \"This has been a wonderful and exciting day to celebrate this breakthrough airplane with our customers, employees, supplier partners and our communities.\"\nThe mid-sized 787 will seat between 210 and 330 passengers, and will be the first commercial airliner of a mostly carbon fibre composites construction. Boeing claims that the resulting reduction of weight compared to the traditional aluminium will offer enhanced fuel efficiency, benefiting both operators and the environment. According to the company, the 787 Dreamliner will use 20 percent less fuel per passenger than similarly sized aircraft.\nOn Saturday, Boeing announced 35 new orders from German airline Air Berlin and ALAFCO Aviation Lease &amp; Finance of Kuwait, bringing the total to 677 orders from 47 customers. At the list price, these orders are worth US$5.62 billion.\nThe first flight is expected to take place in August or September of this year, with the first customer, All Nippon Airways, due to receive their first aircraft in May 2008.\nThe 787 illustrates the differing strategies adopted by Boeing and Airbus whose double-decker A380 first flew in April 2005 and is expected to enter service later this year. Whereas the Airbus A380 is aimed at flying large passenger numbers between major hubs, the Dreamliner is targeted at smaller airports where Boeing predicts will be an area of growth in the industry.\nEarlier in the day, Boeing received a congratulatory letter from Airbus. The company president and CEO Louis Gallois said, \"Today is a great day in aviation history. For, whenever such a milestone is reached in our industry, it always is a reflection of hard work by dedicated people inspired by the wonder of flight. Even if tomorrow Airbus will get back to the business of competing vigorously, today is Boeing's day -- a day to celebrate the 787.\""}

Clashes began last week following mounting antagonism between the mosques hard-line leaders and the government lead by President Pervez Musharraf. \nThe mosque has been accused of enforcing its own Islamic law in the capital, notably the illegal detention of Chinese foreign nationals working in massage parlors.\n20 people have been reported killed over the past six days, which have seen multiple gun battles and demolition of the mosques exterior walls. Currently, there seems little chance of a negotiated resolution. A delegation of Islamic leaders were refused access, and the mosques leader Abdul Rashid Ghazi has declared suicide a favourable option to surrender.\nThe mosques leaders follow the Hanafi school of thought, believing that the Koran is the authority by which justice should be metered. Historically the mosque has had close links with the Pakistan leadership, and members of the current administration have resisted calls for a crackdown on the mosques provocative behaviour.\nThe stand-off represents a decisive ideological challenge to the president who is walking a fine-line between Islamic extremists at home and foreign pressure to crack-down on militancy in the lawless tribal regions.

The final took 3 hours and 45 minutes to complete.\nFederer, who lost to Nadal in the final less than a month ago, equalled Swede 's record of five straight Wimbledon titles. Borg was men singles champions at the between 1976 and 1980. Borg attended the match and met with Federer afterwards to offer his congratulations.\nThe match was very evenly contested throughout all five sets. Federer won the first set in a tiebreak, 9-7, which featured a series of uncharacteristic errors from both players. Both players had broken each other early in the first set.\nFederer was in trouble on serve twice in the second set. He managed to recover from 15-40 down in the sixth game with three successive aces - Federer ended up serving 24 aces in the match to Nadal's one. However, he couldn't repeat the effort in the tenth game, and Nadal broke to close the set out 6-4.\nThe third set went on serve for all twelve games, with no breaks leaving the score at 6-all. Federer won the tiebreak 7-3.\nThe fourth set was entirely different again. Nadal charged out to a 4-0 lead, aided by the assistance of the appeals system. Federer, who has been an outspoken critic of the technology, snapped at the end of the third game after a Nadal ball was called 'out' but overturned after Hawkeye revealed that 2 mm of the ball had touched the back of the line. \"How in the world was that ball in? ... Look at the score now. This system is killing me,\" he said in the direction of the umpire. Nadal went on to win the set 6-2 with no further breaks of serve.\nThe players entered the final set, the first for Federer in his five-year reign as Wimbledon champion, and the defending champion had to scrap to save his first two service games. Down 15-40 in both, he managed to hold on, and it appeared to deflate Nadal. Nadal was then broken by Federer - his first break since the first set - in the sixth game to lead 4-2, with Federer producing some high-quality shots to break the serve. He held serve to love to lead 5-2, and then broke Nadal on his second match point to win the final. \nThe match was the third-longest men's final, at 3 hours 45 minutes, in the history of the Wimbledon championships. Federer has now won eleven Grand Slam titles, and has a record of 11-2 in Grand Slam finals. The two losses were both against Nadal and both at the French Open, the only one of the four Grand Slams he is yet to win."}

The drivers of a truck and a motorcycle passing the building when it exploded were also killed, as were a couple who owned a car wash near to the site. The explosion also buried a number of cars under tons of concrete and blew out windows in nearby buildings.\nPolice estimated that over a ton of TNT was required given the force of the explosion, and noted that the explosives had been manufactured by a factory in the local area. This was backed up by the \"Beijing News\" quoting an investigator as saying \"The explosion was so powerful that there must have been about one tonne of explosives,\". \nThe coal mine the explosives were intended for is one of around 3-400 in the local area, which operate both legally with licences and illegally without.

Phoenix will land in the Red Planet's northern polar region to search for signs of life, and analyze the Martian climate from a polar perspective. \nThe launch period for Phoenix extends from August 3, 2007 until August 24, 2007 and consists of two launch windows per day. A Delta II rocket will carry the spacecraft into Earth's orbit to begin its 122 million mile journey to Mars. \nThe journey is expected to last about 9 months, ending around May 28 at a landing site called Vastitas Borealis in the northern Arctic plains region of Mars. The site was identified in 2002 by the Mars Odyssey orbiter as having large amounts of water ice just below the surface. The high concentration is necessary to ensure that Phoenix will find water ice within reach of its instruments after landing. \nPhoenix will remain on the surface of Mars for about 92 Earth days examining the water ice expected to lie a few inches beneath the rocky surface. The lander contains instruments that will help scientists to determine if life as we know it has ever existed, or currently exists, on this barren planet. The lander will study the atmosphere, surface and subsurface to determine if the Martian Arctic soil could have ever supported life. A detailed analysis of the weather will help scientists determine the Martian climate as well as aid in planning future un-manned and eventually manned missions to our planetary neighbor."}

In the video, it is suggested that the child had been given the drug ecstasy.\nIn the video which was taken off YouTube, the toddler was not in a child seat, appeared unresponsive and was rolling her eyes so only her whites showed. There were comments made in the video that the little girl may have been given ecstasy - one teen in the van said \"Cookie, stop rolling, girl\" and \"you shouldn't have popped no x\". 'X' is a slang term for ecstasy. \nPolice tracked down the people involved via the MySpace and YouTube accounts used to post the video. The local police say it will be hard to prove if she was really given ecstasy since the drug is metabolised by the body within 48 hours. \nIn addition to the infant, three adults and four teens are seen in the video, with the camera being passed around between them. The van was being driven by the 21-year-old mother of the child. The mother, adults and teens are being questioned by the local police while the children are being taken care of by other family members."}

Johnson, has died at her home in Austin, Texas. She was 94. \nShe died of natural causes about 4:18 p.m. CDT (UTC-5). Her family and friends surrounded her when she passed. \nBess Truman, who reached the age of 97, was the only other first lady to live past 90. Lady Bird Johnson became first lady after the assassination of John F. Kennedy. After her husband's presidency, she became known as an advocate of various environmental projects and environmentalism in general.\nAs President Johnson and his wife, Lady Bird, criss-crossed States by road during the 1964 presidential campaign, she informed her husband of her feelings about the roadside junkyards they saw along the way. Inspired by her comments and enthusiasm from audiences, he observed \"If it's beautifying they want, it's beautifying they'll get.\" Recognizing that \"ours is an automobile society,\" the President did not want to curtail roads. He wanted to make roads the \"highways to the enjoyment of nature and beauty.\" Lady Bird thought that her love of seeing Texas highways in spring had influenced her husband. She enjoyed the results of Texan wildflower conservation programs which began in the 1930s.\nOne of the most prominent results of the President's beauty initiative was the Highway Beautification Act of 1965. It created restrictions on billboards and junkyards. As expected, it had been controversial. When the House considered its version of the bill on October 7, the debate lasted into the early morning hours of October 8. A pointed, but tongue-in-cheek amendment by Representative Robert Dole (R-Kan.) to strike out the term \"Secretary of Commerce\" wherever it appeared in the bill and insert the words \"Lady Bird\" lost by a voice vote. Saying, \"Beauty belongs to all the people,\" the President signed the bill and gave the pen to Lady Bird, along with a kiss on the cheek.\nIn 1982, she founded the National Wildflower Research Center to continue the mission of changing public attitudes toward native plants. In 1997 it was renamed the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center."}

The presence of water was observed by using the telescope to examine the absorption spectra as the planet transited across its star.\n\"Finding water on this planet implies that other planets in the universe, possibly even rocky ones, could also have water,\" said co-author Sean Carey of NASA's Spitzer Science Center at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.\nSimilar evidence for another hot gas giant, previously gathered using the Hubble telescope, was not widely accepted due to experimental noise and similar concerns.\nHD 189733b is located 63 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Vulpecula.

However, the jury did clear him of the rest of the charges. Black faces a maximum of 35 years in prison and a US$1 million fine at his sentencing, which is scheduled for November.\nHe was found not guilty of nine other charges including racketeering, misuse of corporate perks and tax evasion. The 13 charges were based on allegations that Black defrauded investors in his company, Chicago-based Hollinger International (now known as Sun-Times Media Group). He was accused of stealing around US$60 million from the company.\nDavid Radler, who was the second-highest ranking officer at Hollinger at the time of the crimes, testified against Black, after admitting fraud himself. Radler testified before the court and jury, that Conrad Black had concocted a scheme where executives of Hollinger could pocket payments when selling small local newspapers that Hollinger owned, in exchange for non-compete agreements.\nBlack's three co-defendants and former associates (Jack Boultbee, Peter Atkinson and Mark Kipnis) were all found guilty of several counts of mail fraud.\n\"We think the verdict vindicates the serious public interest in making sure that when insiders in a corporation deal with money entrusted to them by the shareholders, that they not engage in self-dealing, that they not break the law to benefit themselves instead of the shareholders,\" said U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald, who prosecuted the case. \n\"We intend to appeal and there are viable legal issues.

He agreed to remain in the Chicago area for at least one week. Judge Amy St. Eve confiscated his passport.\nConrad Black renounced his Canadian citizenship in 2001, to become a life peer as Baron Black of Crossharbour.

Even without his Canadian citizenship, Black continues to enjoy the privileges of membership in the Queen's Privy Council for Canada which Brian Mulroney gave him in 1992 which includes the use of a special diplomatic passport."}

After infection by \"Wolbachia\", the fraction of the population that was male dropped drastically to about one percent of the total population. However, after approximately ten generations (about a year) the male population had rebounded to about 39 percent of the overall population. \nIn the case of \"H. bolina\", infected females were unable to have male offspring since the male embryos died early on. However, a gene arose which suppressed \"Wolbachia\"'s ability to kill the male offspring, and this gene spread rapidly through the natural \"H. bolina\" population.\nAt this time, it is unknown if the novel gene was a mutation or a pre-existing gene. However, researchers said that regardless, the findings constituted strong evidence that parasites can drive and substantially alter evolution. The research was performed by scientists at the University of Berkeley lead by Sylvain Charlat, a post-doc at Berkeley.\n\"Wolbachia\" is a bacterium that is very effective at jumping from species to species, generally infecting arthropods such as insects. Since the bacterium resides in the cytoplasm of cells, males cannot pass \"Wolbachia\" onto their offspring because sperms only pass on their nucleus with the DNA, but females can. \"Wolbachia\" has thus adapted a number of strategies, such as killing male embryos of infected females or preventing infected males from reproducing with uninfected females.\n\"Wolbachia\" is dangerous to hosts because it is able to easily jump species barriers and so has little reason to restrain itself -if an infectious organism kills its host, it generally dies along with it. The bacterium is believed to be responsible for some extinction events as well as some speciation events."}

The regulations describe eligible persons as those \"suffering from grave and debilitating illnesses.\" Canada contracts a company, Prairie Plant Systems, to cultivate and package seeds and/or dried marijuana for shipping of a monthly supply to eligible patients. A packet of 30 seeds costs CA$20, plus taxes. Dried marijuana costs patients CA$150 for 30 grams (slightly more than one ounce).\nThe defendant in the legal case was not suffering from an illness and was not in need of an exemption from the possession laws. The man put forth a defence that questioned the legality of the medical exemption since it was only a regulation, not a law. He argued that all possession laws, therefore, should be struck down.\nThe judge presiding over the case, Howard Borenstein, agreed with the argument. \"The government told the public not to worry about access to marijuana,\" said Judge Borenstein. \"They have a policy but not law. In my view that is unconstitutional.\"\nThe defendant's lawyer, Brian McAllister, felt that the ruling may have significant consequences for possession laws throughout the province. \"Obviously, there's thousands of people that get charged with this offence every year,\" said McAllister. He suggested that Ontario residents can cite the new ruling as a defence for possession charges. \"That's probably why the government will likely appeal the decision,\" he said.\nJudge Borenstein will make his ruling official in two weeks time. Prosecutors in the case have said that they will appeal the decision soon.\nIn related news, a Liberal senator from the province of British Columbia, Larry Campbell, said Wednesday that the federal government should decriminalize marijuana and \"tax the hell out of it,\". He said the government should use the revenue for health care priorities. Sales should be controlled by government, he stated, in the same way that alcohol is sold. He noted that organized crime is pulling in large profits on the growing and sale of the drug. \nSenator Campbell also suggested that too many resources are placed on the criminal prosecution of people for possession of small amounts of marijuana. \"This is not a drug that causes criminality,\" he said. \"People are getting criminal records for essentially nothing.\"\nA recent UN survey, the 2007 World Drug Report, has determined that marijuana use in Canada is the highest among developed nations. Some 16.8 percent of Canadians between the ages of 15 and 64 used marijuana in 2004, compared to 12.6 percent of Americans, 8.7 percent for Britain, 8.6 percent for France, 6.9 percent for Germany, and 0.1 percent of Japanese.\nYork University law professor Alan Young, said the report's numbers may be skewed higher for Canadians due to the willingness of Canadians to discuss the issue. \"It's become a large part of youth culture in Canada, and more importantly, 50 percent of marijuana smokers are over the age of 30,\" he said. \"So it's really gone to all age groups, all class groups. There's no question about it that there is less stigma in Canada.\"\nOnly four other countries ranked ahead of Canada on marijuana use: Papua New Guinea, Micronesia, Ghana, and Zambia.\nThe UN data for harder drugs such as amphetamines and ecstasy showed relatively low use among Canadians."}

In the end, in archeology, the ground will tell you the truth,\" said Gillespie's wife, Pat Thrasher.\nIn 1937, Nikumaroro was known as Garner Island, and Gillespie believes that Earhart's plane crashed on the island while Earhart was trying to fly around the globe in her Lockheed 10E Electra. Earhart was supposed to finish her journey and land on Howland Island, but never arrived, and to this day, no trace of her remains or Noonan's, or of the plane have ever been found, but some remains of skeletons found in 1940, pieces of woman shoes and equipment have been recovered in previous trips to the island and Gillespie says that those remains are consistent with Earhart and what her plane would have been carrying at the time it disappeared.\nThe new expedition is centered around radio distress calls that are said to have been made by Earhart just before her plane went missing, but many researchers consider the transmissions an elaborate hoax. However; Gillespie says that when Earhart's plane ran out of fuel, Nikumaroro Island would have been the closest place to land. Nikumaroro is approximately 2\u00bd miles long, and about 350 miles south of Howland Island. Gillespie says that both Earhart and Noonan would likely have survived \"weeks or months\" after the crash, but later died of starvation, lack of fresh water, or may have been severely ill.\nThe team hopes to begin the trip at the end of July or early August, not long after July 24, which is the 110th anniversary of Earhart's birth, and coincides with her disappearance on July 2, 1937.

Thousands of such fans converged on a 7-Eleven store in Los Angeles to witness that store's transformation for the month of July into a Kwik-E-Mart, a fictional convenience store from the popular animated television show.\nAs part of a marketing campaign for an upcoming feature film based on the long-running TV series, twelve of more than 6,000 U.S. and Canadian 7-Eleven stores were effectively converted into the fictional store: the store signs and banners, colors, employees' uniforms and even merchandise were changed to match those shown on TV. Stores were outfitted with Simpsons-themed window displays, cardboard cutouts of the show's characters, and carried such cartoon staples as Squishees and pink donuts that matched those favored by one of the title characters, Homer Simpson.\nWhile initial reports indicated that sales at the converted locations were up by 30%, the scene this weekend at the Los Angeles location left little doubt that the promotion was working \u2014 at least for 7-Eleven. The Los Angeles store was half-encircled by a line of well over a hundred would-be visitors waiting over a half an hour to go inside the convenience store. A security guard controlled the crowd, letting only about 15 people visit the store at a time. As 7-Eleven stores operate 24 hours, this crowd control measure was a round-the-clock operation, with thousands of visitors showing up in a course of a day in a never-ending line.\nOne of the people in line was William, a young man from Hacienda Heights, California, who had heard about the fact that there was a Kwik-E-Mart from a friend. Driving more than 30 miles just to visit a store, he was looking forward to seeing what the store had changed. He was unable to get others in on his enthusiasm, though: a friend declined his invitation to visit the themed store since it \"wasn't a big deal.\" After driving all the way he was prepared to wait at least a half an hour in the line: his patience likely tested as he was not even half-way to the entrance 20 minutes after lining up.\nDespite the wait and the busy atmosphere, the set up was visibly enjoyable for visitors to the location. Families and groups of friends lined up to take pictures in front of plastic 3D models of Simpsons' characters on the wall of the store building. Even the neighbors put up with the circus: living just around the corner, Sharla walked over to the store and waited in line 20 minutes to get a pink movie donut and a drink. She had only positive things to say about the visit to the store, categorizing the whole experience as fun."}

The 33-year-old male that lives there opened the door, as the men outside wore NYPD hats and t-shirts, and had badges hanging around their necks.\nThe men promptly ordered the male victim to the floor. \"When this guy pushed me, he had a gun in my face,\" the victim said. \"I could see the other guy. He motioned to the others, come on, let's go, let's go.\" The intruders shouted \"Where are the drugs?\" as they ransacked the apartment.\nTwo of the men entered the bedroom and sexually assaulted the 30-year-old female. The couple has a five-year-old child, who was sleeping in another bedroom. \"The more I resisted, the more he began to hit me,\" the woman said. She said she was sexually assaulted by two of the men while her boyfriend was bound and guarded.\nPolice said the men then left with a cell phone, a laptop computer, a diamond ring and a gold chain.

The man suffered a head injury when he was pistol-whipped. Police say the robbers got away with a camera, jewelry, and US$5,000 in currency.\nNeighbors told \"NY1\" that they were stunned. \"Frightened.

His lawyers are considering delaying posting his bail surety until his visa issues are resolved. This will allow Haneef to stay in Brisbane near them, his lawyers say.

Lawrence Convention Center over the weekend for the world's largest ever , .\nMany hope to renew acquaintances, or meet new friends. Others look to buy from dealers and artists, or show off new artwork or costumes. Some attend to make money, or even learn a thing or two. But one thing unites them: They're all there to have fun.\nCostly expansion.\nThis year marks the second time this ten-year-old convention has been held in Pittsburgh. Members of the have lived in the region for years, but prior to 2006 their annual gathering took place 300 miles to the east, in .\nFears of union rates kept the growing fan convention away from the Steel City for years, but Anthrocon ultimately outgrew all other options. The purchase and demolition by of its regular hotel, the Adams Mark, led to a cramped last-minute alternative for Anthrocon 2005. Convention leaders became determined to provide a better venue, no matter the cost.\nAnd that cost is high. The convention hall alone runs to $24,000; A/V and labor costs nearly triple that before accounting for the main ballroom. The board of Anthrocon, Inc. seems to like the venue, though, and has booked it through 2009. Its chairman, \u2014 better known in the furry world as \"Uncle Kage\" \u2014 seems determined to keep other fees to a minimum, taking time during the pre-con staff meeting to caution against last-minute extras.\nSimilar touches can be seen elsewhere; bag racks are shared with long-running sci-fi event , and spare paper is kept packed away for next year. It may seem like penny-pinching, but the results speak volumes: Anthrocon has kept in the black for the last three years.\nWhere does the money come from? Attendees pay from $35 to $50 depending on when they register - or perhaps nothing at all, if they worked as a volunteer last year. But that isn't quite enough to cover the costs.\nIt is Anthrocon's sponsors who make up the gap. Of the 2849 registered attendees, hundreds paid $90 or $175 for the privilege of faster registration, a convention t-shirt, and - for the 202 SuperSponsors - preferential seating and free food. This year the price includes a three-course luncheon with the convention's guests of honor; voice actor , (daughter of \"\" artist ) and animation writer .\nProgramming and entertainment.\nThree courses may not sound like much, but for some con-goers the standard fare is cheese pizza and granola bars, consumed between the many panels, workshops and special events. The vast majority of programming is provided by fans, though guests are expected to pass on their experiences in return for accommodation and travel expenses. Tutorials on arts, crafts and fiction are the order of the day, though several more exotic events do stand out.\nThis year's Masquerade (where costumed fans perform skits for the audience) ended with the performers dancing with the audience in the aisles to the tune of the . Earlier that day members of the provided a ninety-minute puppet extravaganza. Comedy plays a significant large part in the lineup, with home-bred entertainers such as Matthew Davis (or \"2, The Ranting Gryphon\") doling out the laughs. Dr. Conway played a part with his Story Hour \u2014 a regular fixture involving personal tales with a humorous spin.\nAnthrocon has historically held itself to three days of activities, though this year's holiday provided an excuse for many to arrive early. For some, the entertainment started early, too; Thursday night saw a staged reading of \"Furry Tales\", a unofficial musical inspired by Anthrocon 2006. The cabaret found itself swamped by furry fans, and was well-received as a comedy, though Anthrocon board members had reservations about the show's accuracy. When its creators admitted not actually having attended a furry convention, Conway told them he \"knew where there was one.\"\nConvention leaders often find themselves having to explain things to those who have heard second-hand accounts. For example, while the of do exist, they're hardly the public orgy depicted \u2014 you'll find furs snuggling together, but conduct in lobby areas remains firmly PG.\nAs for the , there's no denying their popularity. Fursuits are similar in construction to mascot costumes used by companies, schools, and sports teams, however they are personal to the wearer. Surveys suggest that up to 15% of convention attendees have one, and Anthrocon 2007 is no exception, with 353 in the half-hour long Saturday parade; potentially a record for mascots in a procession. were invited to confirm this next year, while convention staff promised more fans in the \"headless lounge\" to keep the costumed critters from overheating. The lounge costs Anthrocon $1,000/day to rent.\nOther groups sought a different brand of comedy. Four \"protesters\" from \"7chan\" stationed themselves outside a daycare center opposite the convention hotel on Saturday. Two wore wigs and bore anti-furry banners. Most attendees treated the \"raiders\" as part of the entertainment, especially after it began to rain. Dr. Conway and Operations Director Douglas Muth eventually took pity on the group, lending them Anthrocon-branded umbrellas.\nAudience.\nAnthrocon has a significant international draw. However, most are native English-speakers \u2014 of the 18 countries represented at the event, the USA, Canada and the UK make up over 98% of attendees.\nWhile other countries have their own furry events, on average they're only about one tenth the size. The largest outside of North America is , which drew 405 in 2006. Anthrocon's closest competition is San Jose's , while Midwest FurFest in Chicago provides a third alternative, spurred by 35% growth last year. Anthrocon's own yearly growth was 14%.\nOntario's \"Feral!\" is set in a campground, but at Anthrocon hotels are a necessity. Many share four or (unofficially) more to a room, skirting the bounds of local fire codes. Part of this is due to the cost. Even at the discount rate, a night in the convention hotel is $125 after tax; furry fans are often young, with little money to spare.\nMoney isn't the only explanation, though. Furry fans are \"social creatures\", and for some Anthrocon represents the only time in the year when they can meet up with friends from around the world. When not attending a panel or watching fellow fans fursuiting, many can be found chatting, drawing or playing games in The Zoo \u2014 the convention's 24-hour social space. If it weren't for the discos, some might never leave.\nArt show and dealers.\nOne prime attraction is the art show. On display are framed and unframed prints and originals, along with a few items of sculpture and even one fursuit head - and almost everything is on sale to the right bidder. Due to time constraints, only the most hotly-contested pieces go to voice auction. This year, one piece breached the $1,000 mark in the PG category - \"Just one more\", by California artist \"Dark Natasha\".\nThe piece was one of a set created by seven prominent furry artists to depict the - in this case, Greed. Adult art commanded a slightly higher price, with one work by \"Taurin Fox\" going for $2,000. But bargains could be had in both sections for those willing to forgo a popular name. A number of items went for the minimum bid, sometimes as low as $10 for large colored pieces.\nAnthrocon does not require artists to pay for display space, though it takes a commission on sales, and will charge artists to ship them back if they are left unsold; a policy which encourages low minimums. Similarly, artists looking to sell commissions for items such as sketches and unofficial convention badges do not have to pay up-front for space in the crowded Artists' Alley \u2014 though they do face the risk of not being able to get a place at all, as happened to some on Friday and Saturday.\nThe convention does require payment for dealers tables, at which works by others may be sold. The fee for a full table is $115, or $70 over regular pre-registration. Extra table space is significantly more expensive, to encourage variety. 245 dealers and assistants registered this year, ranging from professional artists through comic dealers, publishers, musicians, costumers and plush toy vendors.\nCharity and volunteers.\nThe convention supported Animal Friends, a local . Over $6,600 was raised by Sunday night. Of this, $5,053 came from a charity auction featuring 77 items donated by members of the fandom. Some, like a \"\" original, would have been at home in the regular art auction. Other donations, such as the 12-packs of Canadian Coke and the pound of beef jerky, were more esoteric.\nProceeds were down from previous years, which Charity Director Brian Harris unofficially attributed to timing; the fursuit parade ran simultaneously to the charity presentation, and overran part of the auction. While most large furry conventions sponsor charities, not all have such auctions; many simply donate a portion of their \"earnings\" to the cause.\nThe task of managing these events falls to over 130 volunteer staff members, most of whom spend around 12 to 18 hours \"on duty\" during the convention. But they don't do it alone. Security for the event is provided by the red-shirted Dorsai Irregulars, known since the mid-1970s for their activities in the science fiction community. The Dorsai have been associated with Anthrocon since 2002, and plan to expand to other furry conventions, including Connecticut's \"FurFright\". They have also begun to recruit from the furry fandom.\nLocal impact.\nLast year gave local vendors plenty to think about. Dr. Conway reported the total impact on the local economy at $2.5 million. Regardless of the actual figure, the local started taking furry fandom seriously when shelves started coming up bare.\nThis year, vendors thought themselves better-prepared. The Steel City Diner printed 100 shirts celebrating the convention, only to run out on Friday afternoon. The diner met their weekly sales target by Wednesday, and doubled that by Friday night, working through Sunday to keep up with demand.\nNeighboring sub shop Fernando's drew blue paw-marks on the pavement to attract customers, and offered a special $5 menu for attendees. Its proprietor also came to the aid of his furry customers as they were being harassed by a local beggar \u2014 who gave Fernando a mild skull fracture for his trouble.\nWhile local cab drivers had compliments, not everyone appreciated the company. The decided to cancel their booking after hearing about the con, and of the reported being kept up by fans on Wednesday night. The Brewers lost their game the following day. \nThe convention closed with next year's date \u2014 June 26-29 \u2014 along with the announcement of a guest: Disney animator . The event's theme will be \"It's a Jungle Out There!\""}

The injury tolls varied widely, with local news reports saying at least 18 people were injured, while CNN reported that up to 32 people had been hurt.\nPolice said the first bomb was hidden inside a motorcycle helmet and placed in the front basket of a motorbike. The second blast was set off remotely after people had flocked to the blast site. This tactic of using a smaller bomb as a lure, followed by a second stronger bomb, has become more common in the south Thailand insurgency.

She was never fired for her actions, Brady says.\nBrady has agreed to be interviewed by Wikinews to tell his story. All information and claims have been logged with Brady's attorney and federal authorities.\nThe representative from Sprint Nextel, who for safety reasons is only being identified as Jessica, was working at the company's call center in Ontario, Canada where Brady's call to customer service was directed. According to Brady, Jessica then began to call him outside of her job duties at the call center after their first contact. \nBrady called the center around 6:00 p.m. (eastern time) on a Saturday and attempted to receive help on a billing question and to find a way to stop prank calls. Brady requested a \"soc code\", a code placed into the phone, that would allow for the number that was pranking him to be blocked. Unfortunately, Jessica did not know what that was, but tried unsuccessfully to find it. According to Brady, the only thing she could find was \"the ANI feature call centers have.\"\nBrady then described to Jessica the billing issue he was having. He was being charged \"for text messages I was not making\", even though he had unlimited text messaging with his billing plan. Meanwhile, Jessica called for a supervisor to help locate the code. As this customer service request over the phone was taking quite a bit of time, the two of them then started to discuss what two people would normally discuss if just chatting; sports, the weather, movies and music and if Virginia was a nice place to go on vacation. The supervisor then came by Jessica's station with no luck on finding a code.\nLater that night, around 10:30 p.m., Brady received a call. He answered it and much to his surprise, it was Jessica. He answered the phone with the usual \"hello\" and the voice on the other end answered with \"hello Josh.\" Brady was \"surprised\" that she had not said \"hello Mr. Brady.\"\n\"I then asked who it was, and she said Jessica. She told me about her day, and hoped that I did not mind her calling.\" Then according to Brady, she started to describe how much she hated working in a call center, and how the job \"pays the bills\", and asked if she could \"come visit me sometime\". Brady said that he \"immediately started to record\" the call. Brady also stated that Jessica was not aware she was being recorded, and that further conversations were recorded without her knowing.\nThe call lasted about 15 minutes, but Brady said she \"spoke so fast and moved along through things\" that he \"didn't have a chance to talk if I wanted to. It [the call] ended with me interrupting her and telling her I had to go to dinner with a friend.\"\nBrady immediately called customer care back and reported Jessica's actions to a supervisor (Jason), and the Floor Manager (Also named Jessica) at the Coos Bay call center, which is where his call happened to be directed. The advice he received was to \"play along\" and continue to report her actions until they could locate someone \"better equipped\" to handle the situation.\nJessica then began to call \"about every other day or so\" which turned out to be almost 30 calls, according to Brady who reported each call she made to Sprint Nextel.\nSprint Nextel then told Jessica to cease and desist all contact with Brady, but that didn't stop Jessica from contacting him. She somehow found out the screen-name of his AOL Instant Messenger account, and left messages threatening to kill him. Brady logged the messages and faxed them to Sprint, who about a week later sent Brady a letter, saying that his accounts have been terminated.\n\"\"The purpose of this letter is to inform our that our office has received a complaint regarding your recent questionable interactions with our customer care group. Recent interactions with our company have prompted us to formally contact you. Sprint Nextel terms and conditions state that \"termination of services. consistent with this agreement...\"\", said the letter from Sprint Nextel.\nBrady states that Jessica is still employed with Sprint Nextel, despite the fact that all instant messages left by Jessica were forwarded to Sprint Nextel.\nAs recently as July 10, 2007, as many as 1,000 accounts were terminated by Sprint Nextel because customers were complaining too much and asking too many questions about billing.\n\"While we have worked to resolve your issues and questions to the best of our ability, the number of inquiries you have made to us during this time had led us to determine that we are unable to meet your current wireless needs,\" said one letter to a sprint customer as recent as June 29, 2007. The letter states that the service will be terminated just one day after the letter was written despite saying they \"understand switching to a new carrier causes an inconvenience.\"\nTwo weeks ago, Sprint addressed the media about the mass-cancellations. \"These accounts have been researched very carefully,\" Sprint spokeswoman Roni Singleton said. \"We feel strongly that the decisions we made, we stand by them. These decisions weren't made lightly.\"\n\"If the average person is calling less than once per month and these people are calling 40 or 50 times more, that takes away from customer service,\" Singleton said. \"Our priority is to improve the customer experience.\"\nWikinews sent e-mails to Sprint Nextel on July 20 regarding the Brady incident; to date no response has been received.\nUpdate: On July 23, 2007, Wikinews received an email response from a Sprint representative, going to some length to explain the termination of the customers who were calling up to hundreds of times a month. No information was given on the Brady case covered in this article; \"customer privacy considerations\" were cited as the reason and \"no comment\" was Sprint's reply. "}

One person said his doctor had referred him to a vet when he went for a check-up. \"He told me there was a specialist for people like me and gave me an address. When I got there it was a vet.

Not for economic reasons, but because of the persecution of homosexuals going on here. It's impossible for gays to be themselves in Poland\", says Biedro\u0144."}

Although the police said they will not name the individual in question until the person is arrested, previous reports and comments by faculty and staff at the university made it clear that Korn is the man in question. \nAction was taken recently after the threatening behavior escalated and the letters passed beyond being a nuisance. It had gotten to the point where one graduate student and one faculty member were scared about entering the department out of concern for their safety. Korn, a former Messianic Jew who now self-identifies as Christian, allegedly sent various anti-evolution letters to faculty at the university.\nPictures of Korn have now been distributed to faculty with instructions to call police if Korn is spotted. Before going missing, Korn had refused to respond in detail to media requests for his side of the story, but he had sent emails to the Denver Post and has sent copies of those emails to other media sources, such as \"Wired\". Korn later contacted \"Wired\" by telephone where he claimed to be unavailable since he was \"traveling\" and refused to discuss the letters in detail but spent most of the discussion focusing on claimed flaws in evolution. \nA university spokesperson has speculated that one reason police have been reluctant to formally name Korn is that the threats may have not crossed the line of what legally constitute death threats. For example, Korn said that \"He [pastor Jerry Gibson] said that every true Christian should be ready and willing to take up arms to kill the enemies of Christian society. But I believe it is far more effective to take up a pen to kill the enemies of Truth.\" Jeffry Mitton, a professor at the University, has filed for a restraining order against Korn. \nAlthough the United States has had vigorous debate over the Creation-evolution controversy, and anti-evolutionists have engaged in threats and physical violence in some heavily Islamic countries such as Turkey, to date there have been no serious violent incidents in the United States. One possible exception is the unconfirmed attack on Paul Mirecki, a professor at the University of Kansas, in 2005. However, this may have been in response to other comments made by Mirecki that were about the more general culture wars and the Religious right in the United States and not about evolution in particular.

Last January Dr. Cailliau retired from CERN, the European particle physics lab where the WWW emerged.\nWikinews offered the engineer a virtual beer from his native country Belgium, and conducted an e-mail interview with him (which started about three weeks ago) about the history and the future of the web and his life and work.\nWikinews: At the start of this interview, we would like to offer you a fresh pint on a terrace, but since this is an e-mail interview, we will limit ourselves to a virtual beer, which you can enjoy here.\nRobert Cailliau: Yes, I myself once (at the 2nd international WWW Conference, Chicago) said that there is no such thing as a virtual beer: people will still want to sit together. Anyway, here we go.\nHistory of the WWW.\nWikinews: Why did the WWW emerge at a particle physics lab such as CERN? What need did it serve the scientific community at its origin? Was the making of the WWW a case of the right time and the right place/circumstances for someone with the right IT knowledge?\nRobert Cailliau: There were quite a number of hypertext systems around: the Microcosm, Hyper-G, Gopher, even Xanadu. Everyone was experimenting. There were even two independent attempts inside CERN (Tim's and mine)! CERN is an infrastructure used by physicists from all kinds of universities who after their experiments at CERN go back to their institutes. A single experiment brings together many physicists from universities scattered over the globe. Obviously they stay in contact: they have been users of networks and computers for a long time.\nIt's therefore not so surprising that we looked for a system that would allow such a group to consult documents without having to know where the author was or which of the different computers, operating systems, usernames or passwords was needed. There was a need for an automated library.\nThe two attempts at CERN were personal initiatives. When I learned that Tim wanted to use the internet and had made progress towards an implementation, I immediately teamed up with him. But it remained for quite a time a project that was looked at with some apprehension by CERN management.\nIt was partially the result of the right people in the right place, partially chance, but partially driven by a real need. And everything happened under the benevolent eyes of Mike Sendall, Tim's boss.\nWikinews: In the beginning, what challenges did you face inside and outside CERN in the development of this cutting-edge technology?\nRobert Cailliau: A lot of incomprehension, later also some jealousy. And at the start it was difficult to convince the managers that it would grow into a useful tool.\nThere were a number of factors against us. First, the period of home-grown IT solutions was over. The trend was to buy off-the-shelf software.\nSecondly, the entire future of high-energy physics was precarious: there were troubles around the SSC (\"Superconducting Super Collider, red.\") in the U.S. and from the plans of the LHC (\"Large Hadron Collider, red.\") it was clear that something had to give. The SSC was finally scrapped in 1993, but during the entire period the physicists were worrying about other things than hypertexts.\nThirdly, there was always the problem of justifying a project in pure computing within an institute whose mandate is very clearly the science of pure physics.\nOutside CERN there was a desert of hopelessly confused networking. Universities wanted TCP/IP but the telecoms of the European countries were still governmental monopolies, and they resisted this because they were used to different payment schemes.\nI remember a funny exchange between a person from Deutsche Telekom and a group of academics at a conference: they complained about the costs and the slow links. The telecom person replied: \"What do you want? We give you the best X-25 lines and then you run TCP/IP on top of that!\" But we had no choice: TCP/IP was the only protocol usable with all universities of the world.\nAt another occasion I asked a representative of France Telecom for his e-mail address. He gave me an X-400 address and I asked for an internet address. He raised his eyebrows and said: \"Monsieur, vous ne pensez quand-m\u00eame pas que France Telecom va soutenir l'internet?\" (\"Sir, I hope you do not expect that France Telecom will support the internet?\"). And all that happened when the web was already a success, though indeed only in the academic world.\nWikinews: Early browsers were web editors at the same time right? What browser do you use today? Does it have tabbed browsing? How does it compare to the early browsers you've worked with?\nRobert Cailliau: It is true that the browser of the NeXT was also the editor, though it was restricted to the pages on the local server.\nThe current complexity of XHTML, Ajax, CSS etc. precludes I think the efficient combination of the functions of editing and browsing in a single application.\nSomething I do miss are the \"next-previous\" functions of the NeXT browser. Current browsers only permit you to follow a link and then to run back and forth over the path you took (\"back\" and \"forward\"). The NeXT browser had the additional function of following the next link of the previous page (\"next\"). That allowed me to make a page which was a list of pages to be looked at and then to walk that \"path\" with a click per page. It was a simple way to establish a path and save it, totally independently from the target pages and the servers. A kind of \"digest\".\nI know, it's possible to do this with Javascript, but it is not easy and you can't pass such a page in a simple way to just anyone.\nWe also had vector graphics. I'm afraid that SVG has failed, at least I do not see any sites that use it extensively.\nStyle sheets were also incorporated, not very advanced, but the idea was there. CSS did break through.\nToday I use mainly Safari because it uses CSS best and above all for the typography. Even Firefox can learn from Safari's typography. Why is it that so few programs handle text well? Why is typography so lousy on the screen?\nTabbed browsing is a concession to those who can't cope with a multitude of separate windows. Don't really need it. The first browsers always opened a linked page in a new window. But Windows does not use windows: it prefers full-screen. Mosaic was one of the first browsers that used a single window. Why do it simple when it's possible to complicate things?\nWikinews: Search engines have made the mass of data now on the WWW easily searchable. How initially did you foresee the data being indexed?\nRobert Cailliau: Not at all! Or by hand. We had the \"Virtual Library\" or VL, the idea of indexing and classifying pages about a subject by voluntary work of a specialist in that subject. A kind of Wikipedia, but with only the links: the content was distributed outside the VL. The VL had a certain success, but demanded a lot of work. The appearance of search engines made the VL unimportant. \nThe web broke up into servers. The original \"atom\" of the web was the page, now it is the server. Servers link very rarely to other servers and then almost always warn you: \"You will now leave our site!\". In that kind of structure you need a search engine otherwise you can't find anything. But search engines do not let you find your way in the web: they give you a reference, not a path to follow to get there.\nThe first search engine was built by the \"Centre Universitaire d'Informatique\" of the University of Geneva.\nI predicted that search engines would not cope in the long term. Maybe the existence of Google is only an indication that there is still only little available on the web.\nWikinews: You were at the inception of the WWW together with Tim Berners-Lee; what aspects are you responsible for exactly? You've convinced CERN to release the basic code library into the public domain?\nRobert Cailliau: In 1990 I had already left programming for ten years and was doing management. I'm also 8 years older than Tim, who himself was no longer a young programmer. It was evident that I could not compete with twenty year old Unix hackers and soon I stopped meddling with the writing of C code. Anyway I know only one programming language worse than C and that is Javascript.\nI did influence the shapes of the web and the directions of development, but I mainly occupied myself with obtaining the resources necessary to keep the project going. I had a (meager) budget and so I got computers, offices, and above all people: young programmers who can spend a year working at CERN in the framework of its Technical Student Programme. To get all that done I had to plead often with the management.\nI also understood that CERN, as a lab for physics, would never devote a division to the web. Therefore I began to contact true informatics institutes such as INRIA (\"Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique, red.\") and FhG (\"Fraunhofer Society, red.\") , as well as contacting the European Commission. In this I was fortunately supported by Mike Sendall. Mike, who was seen as neutral by CERN management, has done more than anyone else to help the development of the web inside CERN.\nOn the technical side it was not always the best of understanding between me and the team. For example, I was convinced that we needed to build-in a programming language, but the developers, Tim first, were very much opposed. It had to remain completely declarative. Maybe, but the net result is that the programming-vacuum filled itself with the most horrible kluge in the history of computing: Javascript.\nI also remember a big resistance against PostScript, but what do we see now? PDF everywhere. Fortunately PDF is an open standard and it's fairly elegant, but it could have turned out much worse. SVG did not make it.\nTim, who had a longer experience with the internet world, convinced me that the web could only survive if all the code was freely available for everyone who wanted to tinker with it. In 1992-1993 I then worked patiently for some 6 months with CERN's Legal Service to draft a document that put the source code into the public domain. This also implied working to convince the management, up to the Directors, of the need to do so. The result was the document signed on 30 April 1993 that gave the WWW technology to the world.\nDuring the same period I also perceived that the web as a technology had very many aspects. Tim drew what he called the \"metro\": a diagram of the relationships between the existing systems (FTP, SMTP, HTTP, ...) in the form of a stylised map resembling that of the London Underground. That made me think that we needed to deal with a lot more hard computer science than our small team of four or five could intellectually handle. Therefore I began to toy with the idea of an international conference on WWW technologies. Tim was not convinced, but I went ahead.\nNCSA (the National Center for Supercomputer Applications in the U.S.) had just released Mosaic, first for the X-Window/Unix systems, then for Mac and PC. Their group not only had a lot more people, but their leader, Joseph Hardin, was a sociologist of my age. I suspected that he was thinking along the same lines, and I was right: when I launched the call for papers for the first WWW conference in December 1993, I did so just one day before NCSA would have done the same thing.\nIt was a Friday and on Saturday Hardin phoned me at home to discuss the matter. Fortunately our relations were good and he was also very fair by teaming up with my conference in the end.\nBut our team at the time was very weak: NCSA had a big success with Mosaic and they could easily have used their weight to wipe us off the map.\nIt was also a time to understand how underdeveloped our idea of Europe here is. We know that we have to live together on this assembly of peninsulas, but when we have to pull in the same direction then that is politically rather difficult.\nFinally for two years I worked quite hard contributing to the setting up of the Web Consortium. Even afterwards that took much effort and a lot of my time.\nWikinews: There are some fun anecdotes about the beginning of the World Wide Web. We've just offered you a virtual beer, but the idea of the WWW started with a beer too, in this case with a (real) beer with Tim Berners-Lee, right? And there is a reason that the original WWW-logo is green, right? Why is it not called world-wide web, with a hyphen? Are there other anecdotes you want to share with our readers?\nRobert Cailliau: The list is without end.\nAt the second conference, held by NCSA in Chicago, someone asked if it was not better to use the web for conferences instead of travelling to far places. Implusively I answered, in front of 1500 programmers in the audience, that there was no such thing as a virtual beer and therefore we preferred to meet in the flesh. That was 1994.\nIn 1990, months before there was a shred of code, Tim and I wanted to find a good name for the project. Sometimes, after a hard day's work in warm offices we drank a beer on the CERN cafeteria terrace before going home. On one such occasion Tim came up with \"World-Wide Web\". I would have preferred something shorter, but to find a catching name is not easy. I agreed to use WWW for the new document that was to go to management and \"find a better name later\". WWW stayed: it summarised well what it was.\nBecause I'm a synaesthete I see characters in colours and I perceive a W as green. I liked that. So it remained WWW. And there was indeed a logo that we used a lot in the beginning. It was made from three Ws: white, light green and darker green.\nAnd yes, the hyphen was there for a long time too. But it confused people who were not so grammatical, and Tim finally cut the knot by stating that he had the right to decide how it was written since he had invented it: without the hyphen.\nSome anecdotes were less funny: at one time I could have made Alexander Totic of NCSA come to CERN to join us. That was almost arranged when it appeared that Alex had a Serbian passport and CERN at the time did not admit Serbs.\nThe most recent and very positive anecdote is from October 2006: I gave the opening keynote at an Australian conference on e-learning and the internet in education. I started out by saying I knew nothing about education but would give my keynote anyway. In a later talk Jean Johnson presented NotSchool (http://www.notschool.net) and mentioned that the project \"Web for Schools\" of the European Commission had been very important for her work. \nLater I asked her whether she meant the project that ended in a conference in Dublin in 1995. She said yes and asked if I had been there. I then had to admit that I had started that project myself and addressed the audience at the closing session of the Dublin conference and therefore maybe I did know a little about internet in education. It was heartwarming to know that even smaller initiatives had been quite important.\nWikinews: While Tim Berners-Lee wasn't enthusiastic about it, you called for the first International WWW conference. How did those conferences shape the WWW?\nRobert Cailliau: The conferences still run, the 2007 one was in Banff. They are an occasion to meet and work very hard for a few days at the exchange of ideas. The papers of the presentations are published in well-known academic journals. That incites people to prepare well and present to colleagues. Many web technologies started at one of the conferences (proxies, VRML, ...) Working groups are established there. Because many want to go but can do so only when funded by their institute or company, it often means they have to present a paper. Vague ideas are then consolidated and cast into programming code, which otherwise might not happen.\nIn addition the Conference Committee soon convinced the Web Consortium to hold one of its annual meetings in conjunction with the conference. I am no longer involved with this, but at least during the years 1996 to 2004 this synergy was present and a track of the conference was devoted to the work of the Consortium. Therefore Tim was also present every year.\nI always saw the Consortium as the \"church\" with Tim as the \"pope\". In the Consortium there is a set of rules for arriving at decisions after which everyone has to abide by them. There are industrial and sometimes political stakes.\nThe Conferences however, as long as I was member of the Committee, I saw as the \"state\" of \"laymen\"; you had freedom of expression and could propose the most wild schemes. Between church and state I prefer a complete separation.\nThat did not mean of course that we did not collaborate closely between Consortium and Conference Committee: there always was a delegate of the Consortium member of the Committee although that was not a requirement. We wanted both to be successful.\nWikinews: Related to that, I have been told the WWW was initially to run on micropayments. Who had that idea, and why do you believe it never came about?\nRobert Cailliau: It never was in the original goals to use micropayments. However, for keynote speaker of the first conference (May 1994) I had invited David Schaum, an expert in digital money. I was therefore already then convinced of the need for digital money: payment with guaranteed value but not traceable origin. We still do not have anything like that. To me a much more important reason to introduce digital money than untraceability is a free market for information.\nThe ideas of digital payments were targeting sales of goods and payment of subscriptions. To me it is more important to break the vicious triangle of author-reader-advertiser.\nIn the beginning I was often completely misunderstood. There were even newspaper articles that led to hate-mail through incomprehension.\nThe principle of an information market with micropayments is simple and it is not new (the French Minitel has had it since the early 80s).\nThere are currently three ways to put info on the web:\nManner 1 can only if I have other sources of income.\nManner 2 is used often but puts off people because of the high level of the subscription.\nThat bars the reader from using many different sites, e.g. to browse many newspapers. The sum of the subscriptions is too high.\nFor example: I sometimes want to look up a word in the Oxford English Dictionary, but not so often that I find it worth my while to pay for the subscription. Therefore I can't use it at all.\nManner 3 is the most used even if that is not pleasant for the user. For example, Via Michelin, an excellent service, has recently become very irritating because it carries so much advertising, in addition animated as well so that it is difficult to concentrate on what I want to do there for all the moving stuff. Adverts, especially the animated variety, is a pest on useful sites.\nWith micropayments and digital money I would be able to pay Oxford a tiny sum for each time I consult the dictionary, but without having to pay a full subscription.\nA good implementation of micropayments must also provide comfort: I should not have to log in or agree, my computer automatically pays behind the scenes. We are talking here of sums of less than a eurocent.\nAnd I could of course set limits by telling the browser to warn me if I spend more than 10 Euros a day or when a site charges more than a cent for a page, etc.\nIn this way I could read the news in several papers without having to pay a complete subscription to each and having to log in. If they want, sites can of course also distinguish between a paying entrance after which there are no more adverts and things work faster, and an entrance that is free but full of adverts.\nIn short, there is then a true market for information, directly between the seller and the customer. Nothing is obligatory, but a lot more is possible. With the Euro it is now perhaps time to try an experiment with micropayments.\nWikinews: The web was invented in Europe, but it grew exponentially and to some extent the invention has exploded in your face; at any point did you feel that the WWW had been hijacked by the United States?\nRobert Cailliau: The web was hijacked by those who put something in it. They are the people who did not make long ideological or so-called \"intellectual\" reasonings but who put content there. The approach differs greatly between our European parochial little cultures. For example on the whole French companies are pretty bad on the web: there is a lot of aesthetical ado but you can't find the information you are looking for. The Swiss sites, even those written in French, are much more direct and informative.\nThe Dutch do better than the Belgians. There is a large difference between the private sector and government agencies. The sites of the French government are a model of completeness, user friendliness and usefulness, almost completely the opposite of the sites of the private companies of the same country.\nI did not make a study of this phenomenon but it seems there are two large influences: approach to life (Protestant/pragmatic/experimental/Germanic versus catholic/intellectual/cartesian/Latin ?) and language.\nIt's obvious that there is more available in English, say, than in Basque. But that should not surprise anyone. OK, so we have a language problem in Europe. That leads to one of my favourite subjects: language as a technology, but that's for another interview.\nWikinews: How much has the web evolved since the 1970s? What factors are hindering further evolution?\nRobert Cailliau: You probably mean the 90s unless you want to talk internet instead of web. Looking back and from the many conversations with web and internet pioneers, I think not much has changed fundamentally.\nThere was a first explosion of internet services in the 70s (e-mail, chat, file transfer, remote login, ...) then a pause with nothing much until the web involved the public at large from 1995. Two grand phases then: academic development followed by explosion in the public sphere.\nWe must remember two incompatible communication models: telephony (no guaranteed contact but guaranteed bandwidth) and internet (guaranteed contact but no guaranteed bandwidth). Circuit switching and packet switching. Fashion dictates that we should now do everything via TCP/IP. That's fine als long as there is no need for continuous contact (e-mail, web, download) but it is never good enough when that need is present (audio, video, TV). Not to mention tele-surgery. Would you like to be on the operating table knowing that the surgeon on the other side has just TCP/IP between his hand and the scalpel? Probably not.\nThere are applications that need a guaranteed bandwidth and that's not achievable with classic TCP/IP. Of course, the mathematician and the network geek will tell you that there is no difference if you make the bandwidth high enough. True, but I fear that you can also always find an application that's bandwidth hungry enough that those limits need to be put higher again.\nMaybe we find a combination whereby the web is used to initiated a circuit so that the best of both approaches can be had.\nWikinews: What part or period of the history of the World Wide Web did you enjoy most? Which were the most exciting times?\nRobert Cailliau: Enjoy? Only afterwards, except the first conference. There was a euphoric atmosphere that I have seldom experienced. And because I started it myself, it was extremely satisfying.\nThe most exciting period was from end 1991 to end 1994. It was the early period where we sensed very clearly where we wanted to go but had to instill that vision in others.\nIt lasted until the end of WWW at CERN in December 1994. I cannot relate the whole story here, it is told in detail in the book \"How the Web was Born\".\nWikinews: If you could go back into time and change one thing about the start of the WWW, what would it be?\nRobert Cailliau: Isambard Kingdom Brunel, one of the greatest engineers of all times, wrote in 1844 at the height of the railway mania:\nI thought often of that reflection: we advanced far too fast with far too many developers who ran away in far too many different directions without much thinking.\nI don't want to be Cartesian here, but it would have been better if we had more time to build on our ideas before letting the beast loose.\nEspecially the geeks in the U.S. often behaved like cowboys: shoot first, think later. Features were implemented that looked attractive on first sight but turned out to be incompatible with other ones. For example the famous frames, that we still have not got rid of.\nPeople failed to understand the advantage of separating content from presentation, which we had on the NeXT in some sense. Especially graphic artists refused this and that put us back by about five years.\nIf a careful study were made it might well show that we lost much more time and effort managing excesses than we would have spent in a more considerate and paced development.\nI often had the impression I was running like mad to escape from drowning in a tsunami.\nFuture of the WWW.\nWikinews: I've read that scientists at CERN are currently working on grid computing, mainly to process the huge amounts of data from the Large Hadron Collider project. Do you think grid computing will be the next generation web? Are there restrictions that limit the use of grid computing, for example working over large distances?\nRobert Cailliau: About grid computing I have not much to say. The first intention of the ARPANET and later the intenet was the use of computing resources at a distance. Grid computing is an extrapolation of that idea. I don't know if the average user will use grid computing. Most probably not. It seems to me that personal computing stands to grid computing like serial computing stands to parallel computing. There are useful applications of parallel computing, but I don't think my second processor is busy while I'm typing this. Grid computing can be used behind the scenes in certain services, but I find it hard to see what the web surfer will use it for. Google knows what to do with it, I'm sure. So I'll shut up about it.\nWikinews: You've said before that you don't care a lot about the concept of web 2.0, because it was something you envisioned from the beginning, and it was something bound to happen: correct? If not, what is your vision for The Web? What would be a real web Renaissance?\nRobert Cailliau: Web 2.0 is something that indeed \"exists\", but it is not a technology. It is a social phenomenon that requires the simultaneous deployment of a number of technologies to build the so-called 2.0 websites. Delivering web content via blogs and the like is a \"new\" happening in which the individual participates, often in very original ways. Freely contributing to web content was one of the original goals: the web should be as easy to write as it is to read. Another function we lost due to too fast development.\nI'm much more worried about data. All my data are on my home computer and I regularly back them up. I have nothing important on a server: no e-mail, no photos, videos or whatever. But I'm an exception: most people never back up their machines and actually cannot handle a computer. They use the machine as a terminal to the internet.\nServices such as gmail, YouTube, and in fact every site having some kind of \"My-...\" where one leaves a bit of oneself, bring us back to the archaic model of computing: central mainframes and storage, used through terminals on which no local applications run.\nThis trend started to worry me with e-mail first. Because of spam most ISPs stopped relaying mail and I began to have some trouble sending e-mail while on travel. To send mail you have to know the local smtp server. But which hotel receptionist can tell you that? They stare blankly at you, incapable of understanding that you do not use web mail, i.e. that you do not have your messages on a server.\nMoney is virtual, it is a number on a computer in a bank somewhere. We trust the bank: nobody has gold coins in a sock under the mattress.\nBut we have been working on the banking establishment for a few centuries. The last time we had a great crash (depression of 1929) not only a large number of people died of hunger, but it helped bring about the most totalitarian state we ever witnessed (the Third Reich). Since those days we have learned a lot, painfully and with lots of mishaps.\nTherefore now we think that we can trust the banks and the economists with our money. The breakthrough came from government controls and international conventions.\nWith our data it is now as it was with money about two centuries ago: everything is in the hands of uncontrolled private companies, without any legal framework, to say nothing of international agreements.\nBut my data are a part of myself. I want to know how my data are managed, by whom, where, and with what guarantees. Money I may lose but then I grow my potatoes in my garden.\nYou speak of a web-Renaissance. That would be a brilliant light that would let us see that in the information-driven era we need to build new social structures, new forms of creating trust and we need more transparency in the processes of society.\nWikinews: The principle behind wikis such as Wikipedia provides similar functionalities to early web browsers that were web editors at the same time. To which extent is this analogy correct?\nRobert Cailliau: The one great difference, maybe, is that wikis run on servers, but I can of course put a wiki on my home computer or laptop. It's not really wysiwyg but that is not so important.\nWikinews: Do you see wikis as a viable long-term model, or do you expect something else to emerge? On the subjects of wikis, do you refer to Wikipedia?\nRobert Cailliau: I use the Wikipedia often. I also contribute here and there. A very great work, looked at with a lot of jealousy. In almost all comments about the Wikipedia I perceive in the background some jealousy and intolerance.\nThere seems to be a strong reaction from those who derive their prestige from \"secret\" knowledge and consequently find it rather scandalous that everything is now not only lying around to be read but also often debunks their prejudices.\n\"The Wikipedia is full of errors\": maybe, but printed books too and they do not get corrected. It is also totally unrealistic to compare the Wikipedia with a work like the Britannica (for which you need a subscription because we have no micropayments). One should compare the Wikipedia with what people have in their homes (often NOTHING!) or in their heads. If the Wikipedia is as good as the Brittanica, then hats off!\nAre wikis viable in the longer term? I think so. They give authors a frame to work in. Whatever comes later, that frame is important.\nWikinews: You've edited your own article on Wikipedia, did you find it easy to work with? You probably don't have a lot of experience with it, but what is your impression of the MediaWiki software that Wikipedia runs on?\nRobert Cailliau: I find it very good. Precisely because I do not use it often it is important that it is sufficiently simple and intuitive that I do not need a manual. The wiki software fulfills this criterion and is therefore very good: the frame is important.!\nWikinews: Will it be possible to agree on common standards, with the software companies trying to push their own standards? Are there major obstacles for XML?\nRobert Cailliau: We can apparently agree on common standards: OS X is full of XML and even Microsoft now uses XML for its Office products.\nProprietary standards are not bad in themselves. They let one try out new things or be efficient in some ways. I do not object to them on one condition: that there is a way to export all data in an XML form, with all the details I could control through the application transmitted to the XML in recognisable form.\nThe W3 Consortium succeeded in spreading the WWW standards and did even more: several commercial standards converged under its influence.\nThat is the good news.\nWikinews: Lawmakers are lagging behind when it comes to computer- and information-technology. On your site, you say: In a society based on technology it is simply dangerous to make policy on the basis of language constructs only. What is the alternative to language-based policy?\nRobert Cailliau: A few years ago I had to speak about www at the European Parliament in Brussels. I was shocked that there was no way to use anything else than spoken language. No screen, no projector, no whiteboard. How can one say anything sensible about climate change without showing maps, graphs, videos? But perhaps we should first work on the scientific literacy of our politicians. Maybe that won't be necessary if the next form of government grows from web 2.0. I just discovered Newropeans (http://www.newropeans.org). Who knows. The old technology of the spoken language alone certainly no longer works.\nWikinews: There were recently reports in the Belgian media about the rise of reported internet crime. Does that illustrate your call for international regulations of internet behaviour? If someone poses problematic behaviour on the internet, how should he or she be dealt with?\nRobert Cailliau: What do we use in common law? The police searches for the offender and works through a number of procedures. There are rules for establishing complicity. On the net it is only different because time and space break down there.\nProblematic behaviour, as you euphemistically call it, can be exhibited from anywhere and it usually goes very fast. We therefore need a world-wide law. There are however at least three large legal frameworks in conflict here: the European, the US and the Chinese systems. Making those work together is a problem that I do not see solved in time.\nWhat upsets me too is the idea that it is the responsibility of the ISP or service to act. Recently MySpace removed a number of users that were known as sex offenders. They must have used some register. Who decided that? Who transmitted the register? The reaction of Scotland Yard was right: it's not because these people had committed an offence that they should be excluded forever, certainly not when they had served their sentences. Or we should first change the law. But we see more and more cases in which commercial companies take the law in their own hands.\nAnd that makes me worried about what the commercial sector will do in the vacuum that the governments just let be. Much more than about what governments would do.\nThat in turn is related to my worries over leaving my data in the hands of sites rather than having full control myself.\nLet's not forget that the sex offenders maybe did nothing wrong in MySpace. The terms of MySpace are very simple: they have the right to do what they want and to exclude you when they want without reason. In addition they transfer all your data to the U.S., although they are honest enough to warn you that the protection of private data in the U.S. \"may be different\". No, I prefer to stay away from social sites in these circumstances.\nFinally, do these sex offenders have a telephone? That is allowed? And they can use the post office? And the road system with their cars? Yeah, let's just keep on messing about.\nWhat we need to clarify is where the rights and duties are. As guide we still have Montesquieue. Furthermore I have been pleading for years now for an \"internet driving licence\". Last week I heard something similar said in the British House of Commons.\nWikinews: Wikipedia says the semantic web \"derives from W3C director Sir Tim Berners-Lee's vision of the Web as a universal medium for data, information, and knowledge exchange,\" yet you're not a fan of the semantic web, right? Is that because the semantic web will have as a result that \"our daily lives will be handled by machines talking to machines\"? Or, are you in favour of a spread of protocols for different types of transactions and data?\nRobert Cailliau: A difficult question. I would like to have a good semantic web. But I think that the possibilities for abuse and misleading are greater with a semantic web (Tim agreed with that when I submitted the problem to him, but he is a steady believer in the goodness of humanity).\nIt's a theme that runs through this interview: whom can you trust and how do you make the rules that will keep \"problematic behaviour\" within bounds? Only a world-wide convention can help and we are far away from it.\nIt's also a little early to use intelligent machinery. Before we reach artificial intelligence we need to cross the desert of the half-witted machines. And you have no idea how \"half witted\" machines can be.\nMy attitude towards the semantic web is also liked to the remark that we went too fast: maybe here too we should think and experiment first before we let the beast loose!\nWikinews: Can you predict the future of the internet? Are you optimistic, or will it be \", but worse\"?\nRobert Cailliau: Matrix but worse. Flight from reality is an unavoidable side effect of our brain structures. Since thousands of years people prefer to listen to fairy tales than face the boring realities. Still I think Web 2.0 is a good trend: blogs, Wikipedia, rings, all these achievements come from simple people sitting behind their home computers who share with others what they experience, and above all learn from others! This learning outside school is the biggest strength of the web and most hopegiving.\nFinal question.\nWikinews: You've worked at CERN for 33 years: miss it? How do you spend your days now? Do you spend a lot of time on the internet? In which projects are you still involved?\nRobert Cailliau: I had at least four different careers at CERN. While I spent 33 years there, it was as if I changed companies four times. What remained was the environment of colleagues who are modest. A journalist wrote about CERN:\nThat attitude, also that of the Enlightenment, I would not miss for anything. It is much more satisfying to find out for yourself what really goes on than to deliver yourself to dogmas of someone else. Fortunately I have enough friends with similar attitudes both inside and outside CERN.\nDo I spend a lot of time on the net? Well, \"being on the net\" is not an occupation. What I do is exchange ideas, read, learn, contribute (NotSchool among others) and look around. I have always done that. A good part of these activities now happen through the net, but that is just as much or as little relevant as saying that for many things I use electricity.\nI devote time to a number of private projects that have been waiting for a long time and to the problems of education in scientific literacy.\nR."}

As the rain began to fall more heavily, the pit lane filled up with crews from every team expecting all the drivers to change to intermediate tyres at the end of the first lap. However Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, who had started in pole position and was leading the race, skidded across the pit-lane entrance and back out onto the track, forcing him to drive another lap in increasingly wet conditions. \nHaving opted to start the race from the pits on intermediate tyres Marcus Winkelhock, a rookie Spyker-Ferrari driver on his first ever Formula One race, quickly rose to become race leader despite having started the race in last position. \nChampionship leader Lewis Hamilton, who had suffered a crash in the third qualifying session and started 10th on his repaired car, had a perfect start, gaining six places, but made contact with one of the BMWs on the first lap and punctured his left rear tyre. \nWithin several laps the track quickly became flooded, and on lap three Jenson Button, Lewis Hamilton, Adrian Sutil, Nico Rosberg, Scott Speed, Anthony Davidson, and Antonio Liuzzi all aquaplaned off into the gravel trap at the same place - Liuzzi making contact with the tractor attempting to recover the other cars. The safety car was deployed for several laps but the increasingly dangerous conditions forced race officials to red-flag the race, bringing it to a complete stop until the rain cleared up, and drivers once again gathered on the starting grid for a restart. Despite needing to have his car lifted out of the gravel trap by a crane, Hamilton managed to keep his engine running, and in accordance with the rules regarding being moved from a dangerous position, was allowed to rejoin the restarting grid in last place, albeit a lap down on all the other drivers. \nAfter about half an hour of stoppage, Winkelhock then led the pack off in a flying start behind the safety car. He was quickly overtaken by almost every car, before retiring due to mechanical problems. \nFor most of the race Felipe Massa led, pursued by world champion Fernando Alonso. Hamilton was the fastest driver on the track, but even at three seconds a lap faster than the other back-markers it took him a long time to catch the pack.\nRain was predicted to recommence approximately 20 minutes before the end of the race. Renault took a gamble by bringing Heikki Kovalainen in first for a tyre change, but they were too early, and he quickly dropped back from fifth position. Several laps later, there was a rush into the pits, with nobody wanting additional risks on the wet track. The \"extreme wet\" tyres reduced the pace of Massa's Ferrari and allowed Alonso to come closer and push hard on his rival.\nAfter two laps of constant pressure and overtaking attempts, Alonso passed Massa, and held him off until the finish. The aggressive attack style chosen by Spaniard caused a slight contact between their cars.\nKimi Raikkonen had been close behind Alonso, but his car suffered a breakdown and he had to park it alongside the track.\nMark Webber drove his Red Bull-Renault to the third place. His teammate David Coulthard also made a nice race finishing 5th from his 20th place on the starting grid. This became the most successful result for Red Bull in this season.\nStill the third place of Webber was under threat from Alexander Wurz from Williams-Toyota who came closer and closer up to the finish line which they crossed with +0,263 sec distance.\nThe two BMW Saubers ended 6th and 7th. And the top eight was closed by Heikki Kovalainen from Renault.\nFor the first time from his debut Lewis Hamilton finished outside the points. His consistently quick pace throughout the race raised him up to tenth place, and in a final gamble he attempted to stay out on dry tyres during the second downpour. This raised him into the points temporarily, but after several slow laps he was forced to pit, and dropped back to tenth. In the dying laps he came within several seconds of Giancarlo Fisichella and Heikki Kovalainen, but although he managed to pass Fisichella, Kovalaninen remained out of reach, and Hamilton had to settle for ninth place. He remains leader of the drivers' championship, but now only 2 points ahead of Alonso.\nThis was the first wet race since the 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix."}

Under the German Presidency of the Union, leaders agreed to drop the proposed Constitution and its state-like elements, yet retain many of its institutional reforms: described by Angela Merkel (German Chancellor and then-Council President) in the terms \"\u201cThe fundamentals of the Constitution have been maintained in large part \u2026 We have renounced everything that makes people think of a state, like the flag and the national anthem.\u201d\" This mandate is now going to be taken by the IGC, composed of national and European government officials, and converted into a legal text.\nNegotiations are expected to go smoothly. Poland had originally intended to kick up a storm over the chosen voting system, as it stood to lose from the proposed QMV system and favoured keeping the old system or using an alternative. The negotiations concluded that the implementation of the new system would be delayed until 2014. Poland also claimed it had secured a Gentlemen's agreement that it could veto decisions for a further two years, but this was denied by other members. Isolated, Poland relented and agreed to back official agreement, with a minister stating: \"Our priority is not to block decisions - we're interested in easier decision-making because we want the Union to function properly.\" The Polish Prime Minister stated that despite some opposition in Poland, there is no threat to governments' ability to ratify the document.\nThe IGC should conclude in Lisbon during October of this year and would shortly after be signed in the city; therefore, the city will give its name to the treaty. This will allow ratification throughout 2008 so it can come into force before the 2009 European elections. Most national ratification is expected to take place without referenda, to avoid a repeat of the \"no\" votes that halted the European Constitution."}

Next summer, the minimum will increase by another 70 cents per hour, followed by another bump of 70 cents in the following summer, bringing the minimum wage to US$7.25 an hour by 2009.\nThe increase is aimed at helping minimum wage earners keep above the poverty level. The United States Department of Health and Human Services considers anyone who earns less than $10,210 per year to be in poverty. At the previous minimum wage level, a person working 40 hours a week would only exceed this by $500 a year.\nAs many as 20 states took the initiative to raise minimum wages before this federal government action became effective. Those states will only be affected by the new law if they fall beneath the new federal mandate.\nBy comparison, today's current minimum wage for adults in the United Kingdom is equivalent to almost $11.50. As of 2005, Mexico's minimum wage was Mex$4.50. The lowest minimum wage in Canada is C$6.50 in New Brunswick.

WFP says the attacks constrain its ability to feed the more than two million people in the area receiving aid. \nNegotiations over a UN Security Council resolution authorising a joint UN-African Union security force for the region continue but full deployment could take up to a year.\n\"In the last two weeks, nine food convoys have been attacked by gunmen across Darfur,\" said Kenro Oshidari, WFP Sudan Representative. \"WFP staff and contractors are being stopped at gunpoint, dragged out of their vehicles and robbed with alarming frequency,\" he said. \n\"These abhorrent attacks, which target the very people who are trying to help the most vulnerable in Darfur, must be brought under control,\" he added.\nA WFP official told \"Wikinews\" that the attacks and robberies have occurred in all regions of Darfur, and that the blame can't be ascribed to a particular group. \"Frequently the bandits are wearing uniforms but often in one group of bandits there may be more than one uniform. Thus, we are not pointing fingers at any one group.\" said Emilia Casella, WFP Spokesperson for Sudan. \"We are calling on all parties to respect the neutrality of humanitarian convoys and their drivers, who are delivering food to civilians who are victims of the conflict.\"\nAccording to WFP, in 2007 so far, 18 WFP convoys have been attacked - \"shot at, looted, drivers robbed and/or injured\". Four vehicles were stopped and the drivers and passengers robbed. Six vehicles were stolen, where the gunmen drove away with the WFP staff members still inside, though they were later released. \"There were no major physical injuries, but naturally such experiences are very traumatic,\" said Casella. \"These incidents have occurred in all three of the Darfurs, in areas controlled by various groups or the government.\"\nIn the week of July 15-21, there were five incidents in South Darfur, during which a total of seven trucks were looted of approximately 10.5 tonnes of food assistance.\nThe Darfur operation is the WFP's largest humanitarian mission, with about 790 staff working to feed more than two million people every month.\nThe WFP indicated that it has been difficult to hire and retain the commercial trucking companies used to move food and supplies throughout the region due to the risks involved in the service. WFP Public Affairs Officer in Washington D.C. Jennifer Parmelee told Wikinews that \"hiring reliable transport in other insecure environments, [such as] Afghanistan and Somalia, is extremely challenging.\"\nAir service is employed for remote locations and where delivery by road has become too dangerous.\nParmelee told Wikinews that the \"increasing insecurity will almost certainly further constrain [WFP's] ability to operate in Darfur - it already has.\" WFP Spokesperson for Sudan, Emilia Casella, indicated that \"humanitarian access is likely to be increasingly difficult due to insecurity.\" However, the situation has not prevented all aid delivery. \"Despite insecurity and access problems, WFP food assistance reached about 2.6 million people in Darfur last month,\" said Casella.\nProposed African Union-UN hybrid force.\nA UN resolution on the deployment of a hybrid African Union (AU) and UN force of 26,000 troops is working its way through the UN. Britain and France presented revisions to the draft, which dropped a threat of \"further measures\" against Sudan for obstructing peace efforts, though Sudan's ambassador, Abdalmahmood Abdalhaleem, has objected to the revisions.\nA deadline of December 31 exists to transfer authority in Sudan's Darfur region from the AU to the proposed AU-UN force. Full deployment of all 26,000 troops would take up to one year.\nThe draft resolution would allow the use of force to protect the mission's personnel and humanitarian workers and would \"protect civilians under threat of physical violence\".\nJennifer Parmelee of the WFP suggests that the deployment of the hybrid force under such a mandate would be a positive development in the aid agency's ability to carry out their humanitarian assistance. \"Sure an expanded AU/UN peacekeeping force would help.\" said Parmelee. \"As it is, AU is stretched very very thin, and...is unable to accompany most of our convoys.\"\nAccording to WFP, there are approximately 12,000 humanitarian workers in Darfur, which is a drop in numbers even though the need for aid workers has increased.

Like how far? Oh jeez\", followed by \"3, I'm right over you. 15's right over you.\" Moments later, the sound of the crash was heard over the air on Channel 15's signal, which then went to static."}

He said that one of his prosecutors told the court that the SIM card at the centre of the affair was found in a Jeep which was laden with explosives and driven into Glasgow International Airport on June 30. \n\"The first related to the SIM card and was based on a misunderstanding of the facts,\" Bugg said.\n\"The second related to the residence of Dr. Haneef in the U.K. and was based on incorrect material provided by the AFP.\"\nAustralian Federal Police chief Mick Kelty denied that the AFP had made any mistakes and said investigations would continue. He refused to rule out laying further charges against Dr Haneef.\nAustralian Immigration Minister Kevin Andrews who previously suspended Dr Haneef's work visa after he was granted bail has said he will review his decision to cancel the visa on character grounds. Mr Andrews said that Haneef had to reside in a place of his choosing and was free to move about the community but had to report to Immigration officials daily by telephone and in person every few days.\nSpeaking last night, Prime Minister John Howard attempted to distance his government from the affair claiming that his government had no control over how the police operate. \nAustralian civil rights groups and political parties have strongly criticised the handling of the investigations.\nHaneef accompanied by his lawyer Peter Russo and his cousin Imran Siddiqui when he flew out of Brisbane Airport on Thai Airways flight TG 992 to Bangalore, India."}
