Reports state that 205 websites were closed recently because of their illegal Internet activity.\nChinese officials state that in the period between September and January they have investigated 436 cases of Internet piracy and ordered 361 Internet offenders to stop infringement of the copyright law. Overseas organizations requested investigation of 130 cases. \nYan Xiaohong, who is currently the deputy director of the National Copyright Association, mentioned at a news conference that Internet piracy in China caused serious damage to the interests of the copyright owners. This, he says, leads to a number of disputes, which, in their turn lead to disruption of the orderly functioning of the Internet.\nMost of the investigated cases involved sites that offered a free download of software, movies, music and textbooks. The main reasons why Chinese people actively download pirated works are the high prices on authorized copies and restrictions on cultural imports set by the Chinese government.\nAccording to the numbers provided by Chinese officials, China has around 843,000 websites and 140 million users, which means that China is the second largest Internet market in the world. Mr. Yan Xiaohong outlined the fact that due to the quick pace of China's development, it may take some time to effectively fight Internet piracy."}

She was 39.\nParamedics are reported to have performed CPR on the actress and had to have breathing equipment inserted into her chest after a nurse found her passed out in her hotel room and witnesses say that Smith was receiving CPR while the ambulance took her to the hospital around 2:00 p.m. [EST]. Smith's bodyguard is reported to have given Smith \"cardiopulmonary resuscitation\" before paramedics arrived.\n\"I can confirm that she is deceased. It's as shocking to me as to you guys. I don't know what the cause was. This is just tragic and that's all you can say right now and I don't know anything further,\" said one of Anna Nicole's lawyers, Ron Rale.\nSmith was taken by ambulance to Memorial Regional Hospital and \"checked in Monday [to the hotel] at 8 p.m. as a guest. She was due to check out tomorrow,\" said cafe spokeswoman, Danielle Giordaano.\n\"Our rescue crews got there, and they were escorted to a bedroom, where they found a female alone in her room and unresponsive. We then began our normal protocol for dealing with a non-breathing individual. The victim never regained consciousness and we continued with CPR and all life-support methods right up until the time we delivered her to the hospital and then the hospital takes over,\" said a spokesman for the responding paramedics team. Smith was pronounced dead at the hospital at 2:49 p.m. [EST].\nAccording to Broward County Medical Examiner's Office investigator, Edwina Johnson, an autopsy will be performed on Smith on Friday and that her death is currently being investigated. Authorities are not yet treating her death as a crime.\nOne of Smith's attorneys, Howard K. Stern, is reported to have been staying with Smith in her room, but authorities have yet to locate Mr. Stern. Mr. Stern is identified by \"TRIMSPA\" as Smith's husband.\n\"He was here with her. I don't know where he's at right now,\" said Charlie Tiger the chief of the Seminole Police Department also adding that Smith's 5 month old baby was not with them.\nSmith was a spokeswoman for the company \"TRIMSPA\" when she passed, and TrimSpa has removed all content from their site for now, shutting it down and posting only a message in response to her death.\n\"Today, Anna Nicole Smith\u2019s grief stricken and tumultuous personal life came to an end.

If passed, marriage in the state would be limited to men and women who are able to have children. In order to receive a marriage license, a couple would have to assert that they \"know of no reason\" that they cannot have children. If they did not have children within three years, their marriages would be subject to annulment. All other marriages would be defined as 'unrecognized' and people in them would be ineligible to receive any marriage benefits.\nWA-DOMA formed in 2006 in response to the decision in the case Andersen v. King County, where the state Supreme Court upheld Washington's ban on same-sex marriage. The court found the 1998 Defense of Marriage Act, which restricts marriage to unions between a man and woman, was proper. In the decision, the court reasoned that there was a \"legitimate state interest\" in limiting marriage to couples capable of having children.\nWA-DOMA is in favor of gay marriage rights. The purpose of the initiative, according to founder Gregory Gadow, is to show that the logic behind the DOMA ruling is absurd. 'For many years, social conservatives have claimed that marriage exists solely for the purpose of procreation ... The time has come for these conservatives to be dosed with their own medicine,' said Gadow. 'If same-sex couples should be barred from marriage because they can not have children together, it follows that all couples who cannot or will not have children together should equally be barred from marriage.' \nSupporters of I-957 must gather at least 224,800 valid signatures by July 6 to put it on the November ballot. The alliance says if the initiative were passed, the state supreme court would likely strike it down as unconstitutional, which would in turn weaken the Court's reasoning in upholding the Defense of Marriage Act.\nThe measure's backers have said they are planning two additional initiatives. One would prohibit divorce or separation when a married couple has children, and would make having a child together the equivalent of marriage.\nOther gay rights groups do not support the paper. Activist Bill Dubay commented that while he gets the point of the initiative, it is unlikely he would sign it. The gay advocacy group Equal Rights Washington does not endorse the bill, stressing that that families come in all forms, with or without children, and that laws should help families, not hurt them."}

Mortgage Interest Relief, which is a significant factor in most people\u2019s finances, with a marginal rate of 52%, had been threatened by the SP manifesto, but the compromise deal announced by the parties left Mortgage Interest Relief unchanged in return for a continuation of the tight legal restrictions on rent increases that had been threatened by the previous government.\nIn another key concession, the CDA reversed the hard line asylum policy that it introduced with its previous coalition partners, the VVD, and introduced an amnesty of all illegal immigrants who arrived in the country before 2001.\nThe publication of the government agenda (the \u201cCoalitieakkoord\u201d) outlines policies in a number of main areas:\nFollowing the nomination of Balkenende as \"formateur\" of the new government the haggling of cabinet and government jobs will be the last element in sealing the deal.

About 3,000 HIV-negative people will be administered the test vaccine MRKAd5 HIV-1 created by the pharmaceutical company Merck. The study will examine if the vaccine prevents infection or lowers HIV levels in those who do get infected. \nA parallel study will also be conducted in the United States and South America, to compare the vaccine's effectiveness on various strains of HIV. The vaccine's functioning in a heterosexual population and its effectiveness among women will also be studied. Preliminary trials for the vaccine have been conducted in the Americas and Australia as well as in Africa. \nAIDS is estimated to have killed 25 million people worldwide since 1981, and between 33 and 46 million more are estimated to be infected with HIV, more than half of them in Sub-Saharan Africa. Between three and six million people are thought to have been infected in 2005.\nThe trial, named the Phambili (\"Going forward\") Trial, is being conducted by the International HIV Trials Network and the South African AIDS Vaccine Initiative (SAAVI).\nThe vaccine has been developed from an adenovirus, a type of virus that causes the common cold. The virus has been genetically engineered to prevent it from causing the flu or from passing on from person to person. Instead, three genes of the HIV virus have been introduced into the adenovirus. When the vaccine containing these genes is injected into the body, it is hoped that the body's immune system will learn to recognise and kill cells that contain the vaccine, thereby also developing an immune response against the HIV virus, which also contains these three genes. \nThe three genes, called \"gag\", \"pol\" and \"env\" contain information needed to make the structural proteins for the capsid, the \"shell\" of the HIV viron. The vaccine does not contain the remaining six HIV genes that cause HIV to infect cells, replicate and cause disease.\nThe vaccine does not contain any live HIV and therefore cannot cause any infection, SAAVI said in a press release, adding that the vaccine was found to be safe and produced an immune response against HIV in earlier trials. \nSAAVI has expressed its commitment to the \"highest level of preventive care\" for those who take part in the trial, promising \"extensive, state-of-the-art\" counselling as well as some forms of medical care and for those taking part, through the duration of the trial. \nThe trial starts a week after a different trial, involving a microbicide gel called Ushercell was stopped after more women who used the gel were found to be infected compared to those who were given a dummy gel as placebo. Eleven previous trials of the gel had not shown any problems, the chief scientist for the trial in South Africa told \"Business Day\". \nThe trial is expected to cost $35 million and SAAVI will be supported by Eskom and the South African government."}

The \u201cUnified New Orleans Plan\u201d is a multi-faceted document that incorporates a number of different recovery planning efforts, including federal infrastructure plans and specific small-scale blueprints developed by individual neighborhoods. \nResidents overwhelmingly approved the comprehensive recovery and rebuilding plan, which is expected to be reviewed and ratified by the city in February. The plan offers incentives for raising houses. \nConcerns have been raised over whether some of the hard lessons taught by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita have been learnt. \"The Washington Post\" reports that some residents are beginning to rebuild their homes in the same vulnerable floodplains that in Fall 2005 were under 10 to 20 feet of water. Despite the threat, a surprising amount of the new development in New Orleans is being built without raised foundations. \nMayor C. Ray Nagin has been a proponent of allowing people to return to their old neighborhoods, even if they are particularly vulnerable. But as rebuilding continues, planning officials recognize that encouraging people to return to susceptible floodplains could pose another big problem down the road.\nThe Bush administration wants to dedicate 3.1 billion dollars to the repairs of flood defences.\nAccording to a study by the Rand Corporation in three years the city will have a population of only 275,000 compared to 465,000 inhabitants before Hurricane Katrina. \nThe disaster also brings the unique opportunity for modernization. Ecological activist organizations have been writing green guidelines for New Orleans schools that the Louisiana Recovery Authority wants to incorporate into its plan.\nIn American history, the challenge to rebuild vast swaths of a city is comparable to the great Chicago Fire of 1871 and the San Francisco earthquake of 1906. Both projects were much further along in their recovery 18 months after the tragedy than New Orleans is today."}

He says there's still no funding from the federal government, and only $1 million has been raised through donations\u2014leaving $500,000 to go.\nThe rising cost of construction and October snow have also slowed progress."}

The earthen ramp bridge leads to a hilltop compound known as the Temple Mount to Jews and as the Noble Sanctuary to Muslims. The bridge collapsed in 2004 and was temporarily replaced with a wooden bridge which Israelis say is weakening and unsafe. Israel has controlled the contentious compound since the 1967 Mideast War,\nThe construction involves excavation work and digging at the site, which Palestinian leaders contend is part of an attempt to dig under the mosque to find evidence of the Jewish Second Temple and/or to deliberately weaken the foundation of the mosque. Muslims dispute that the Temple was located at the site. Some artifacts have been salvaged from the digging work.\nIsraeli forces locked down Palestinian neighborhoods of Jerusalem in anticipation of backlashes from the construction. The Old Jerusalem city limits were blockaded, allowing only Palestinians over 45 years old from entering and only on foot. Palestinians from the West Bank were completely barred. Opponents have declared the blockades and the construction work a deliberate act to prevent Muslims from accessing the holy site. The mass of protesters at the site have in turn blocked Jewish access to the Western Wall.\nPalestinian president Mahmoud Abbas declared the construction and blockade as \"hostile measures\" against Muslims. Palestinian chief justice Tayssir al-Tamimi declared a \"day of anger\" and called on Palestinians to defend the mosque. \nArab and Muslim countries including Jordan, Malaysia and Indonesia criticized Israel for the controversial work and urged it to halt construction. Israeli defense minister Amir Peretz also warned against starting construction. The leader of the Pakistan Muslim League urged Muslim countries to freeze diplomatic ties with Israel in protest of the work.\nAround 150 Muslims were inside the mosque for morning prayers when the construction and blockade began. An Israeli Muslim journalist reported that the worshippers were unable to leave and received loud messages from Israeli loudspeakers.\nThe al-Aqsa mosque is the third holiest site in Islam, having once been the central point of prayer (qibla) for Muslims and allegedly the place where Muhammad ascended into heaven. Conventional Judaism believes it is also the historic site of the First and Second Temples, the holiest temple in Judaism, which is prophesised to be rebuilt ahead of the coming of the Messiah.\nNo deaths have been reported in the clashes, which simmered by evening.\nDemonstrations also took place at mosques throughout the Muslim world, including Egypt and Jordan. Protests were expected later in the day in Nazareth.\nThe incident comes only a few days after rival Palestinian political factions, Hamas and Fatah, came to an agreement for a unity government aimed at restoring international support of Palestine and a return to Israeli negotiations.

A relatively new term - \"Colony Collapse Disorder\" is being used to describe this poorly understood phenomenon. \nColony Collapse Disorder (or CCD) is a syndrome evidenced by massive die-off affecting an entire insect population. The cause of the syndrome is not yet well understood. CCD may be caused by mites or associated diseases or unknown pathogens. CCD is possibly linked to pesticide use though several studies have found no common environmental factors between unrelated outbreaks studied. According to Dennis vanEngelsdorp, a bee specialist with the Pennsylvania State Department of Agriculture, \"We are pretty sure, but not certain, that it is a contagious disease.\"\nHoney-bees are responsible for approximately one third of the United States crop pollination including such species as: peaches, soybeans, apples, pears, pumpkins, cucumbers, cherries, raspberries, blackberries and strawberries.\nFrom 1971 to 2006, approximately one half of the U.S. honey-bee colonies vanished. The rate of attrition reached new proportions in the year 2006, which were alarming to many farmers and honey-bee scientists.\nAt least eleven different states as well as portions of Canada are known to have been affected by colony collapse disorder. The disorder has been identified in a geographically diverse group of states including Georgia, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and California. In some states the loss of honey-bee colonies is estimated as high as 75 percent of the population. \nThe phenomenon is particularly important for crops such as almond growing in California, where honey-bees are the predominant pollinator and the crop value is $US 1.5 billion. Total U.S. crops that are wholly dependent on the honey-bee are known to exceed $US 15 billion. \nIn a related development on January 17, 2007, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has drastically tightened use rules on some of the chief pesticides used on apples, blueberries, grapes, peaches, pears and other fruits pollenized by honey-bees. Citing general environmental protection and farmworker safety, the EPA recently announced the tightening of use or phaseout of the highly toxic pesticides phosmet and Azinphos methyl. Under these rule changes the use of these organophosphate pesticide would be allowed continued use for five years but have somewhat reduced dosage limits. Azinphos methyl is a dangerous neurotoxin derived from nerve agents used during World War II."}

Testing showed that DCA attacked cancer cells but did not attack healthy cells. \nThe researchers and the Alberta Cancer Board and Capital Health do not advise the use of DCA to treat cancer yet, as clinical trials for the drugs use to treat cancer have not been performed yet. \nUnlike healthy cells, cancerous cells do not convert food molecules into energy in the mitochondria. Instead, they rely on a process \nknown as glycolysis, which takes place in the main body of the cell, while the mitochondria are \"shut down\", researchers believe possibly due to the lack of oxygen supply to cells in the middle of a tumor.\nThis means that another key function of the mitochondria - to activate an abnormal cell's self-destruct mechanism, apoptosis - is also blocked. \nWhen Dichloroacetate (DCA) enters a cancer cell, it restarts the mitochondria which in turn activate apoptosis, and the cancerous cell destroys itself.\nDCA is known to be relatively safe, although pain, numbness and gait disturbances may occur.

I would also note that we have close to 140,000 troops on the ground now, and my understanding is that Mr Howard has deployed 1,400\", said Mr Obama.\nThe Australian government said its contribution to the war in Iraq was appropriate given Australia's population and military size and that Obama's response failed to address the \"substance of the issue\". Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said 20,000 troops would be \"half of our army\".\nMr Howard, considered a close ally of the United States government, has faced attacks and support from US politicians.\nDemocrat Terry McAuliffe said \"Firstly, the Prime Minister has been a great friend of George Bush's. He has been with him lock-step from day one on this war in Iraq.\"\nRepublican presidential candidate Duncan Hunter said Howard had earned a right to comment about Obama's policy \"I think the Aussies have earned a right to comment on the world stage about their partner in this endeavour, because they've been fighting side-by-side with us in Iraq,\" said Hunter.\n\"And so I think that John Howard, while it wasn't a very complimentary statement, he is basically stating the truth and that is that what we say on the Senate floor on or the House floor goes to a world audience.\"\n\"And it has an impact on not only our allies, but also our adversaries.\"\nRoy Ryden, another US Democrat said Mr Howard's comment was \"bizarre\" and accused the Prime minister of interfering with US politics \"The most charitable thing you can say about Mr Howard's comment is bizarre. You know, we'll make our own judgements in this country with respect to elections and Barack Obama is a terrific public servant.\"\nMr Howard has drawn criticism from some conservative Republicans with John Cornyn saying Howard should stay out of US domestic politics.\nThe Australian Prime Minster further defended his statement today, claiming Obama's plan threatened Australia's national security.\n\"If the United States were to withdraw her combat units from Iraq by the early part of next year it could only be represented as a defeat for the United States in Iraq,\" he said.\n\"I hold the strongest possible view that it is contrary to the security interests of this country for America to be defeated in Iraq.\"\nAustralia's strong links to the United States and its support for the U.S.-led war on Iraq were key issues for Howard's fourth straight election win in late 2004. The Australian opposition has used the comments as an opportunity to attack the government. Opposition leader Kevin Rudd said Howard needed to avoid taking sides in American politics as it was important for the Australia-U.S. alliance that leaders could deal with each other despite their political affiliations."}

IBM's new product is called \u201cOpen Client Offering\u201d. The company hopes that its product will put Macintosh or Linux software on a more equal footing with Windows.\nThe Open Client Offering software was developed by IBM in-house, as well as with partners like Novell Inc. and Red Hat Inc. It is to answer the questions regarding the cost-effectiveness of managing Linux or Apple desktop personal computers alongside Windows PCs. \nIBM officials stated that Open Client Offering will allow enterprises to use the same software on Windows, Linux or Apple's OS X. It will be unnecessary for companies using Open Client to pay Microsoft for licenses for operations because these will no longer rely on Windows-based software.\nScott Handy, IBM's vice president of Linux and open source, stated that the company worked together with the open source community and in the end found a way to develop a software that is able to function regardless of the operating system.\nTo create an alternative to Microsoft, IBM is going to offer Open Document Format software that the company developed for word processing, spreadsheets or presentations, instant messaging and blog tools and Internet Explorer's long time rival \u2013 Firefox Web browser. \nThe software developers at IBM believe that the usage of Open Client Offering can cut the cost of managing applications as well as maintenance and cost regarding customer support on company networks that require other software rather than Windows.\nPSA Peugeot Citroen, being the second largest car manufacturer, signed a multi-year agreement with Novell, which is the provider of Linux software, to run Linux on its 20,000 desktop PCs. In addition Linux will be installed on 2,500 server computers. \nRedMonk's analyst, Stephen O'Grady, said that today there is a strong appetite for Windows alternatives. However, he said, this doesn't mean that the alternatives are to displace Windows wholesales. O'Grady outlined that no one is going to significantly damage the desktop dominance of Microsoft."}

Defense Secretary Robert Gates told reporters in Madrid on Friday that the there was \"pretty good\" evidence that Iranians are supplying either weapons or technology to Iraqi militants. No recording devices of any kind were allowed during the press conference. \nReacting to the U.S. claims, Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in a television interview that the allegations were \"excuses to prolong the stay\" of the U.S. military in Iraq, and that the U.S. was pointing fingers at others in an effort to \"hide its defeats and failures\"; however in an interview with Diane Sawyer on February 12th, Ahmadinejad refused to address accusations that his country was supplying weapons to insurgents in Iraq. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hossein termed the accusations baseless propaganda and said that the U.S. had a long history of \"fabricating evidence\". \nAmerican officials displayed weaponry including Explosively Formed Penetrators (EFPs) and thermal detectors used for remotely exploding bombs. Some of the weapons parts bear the markings that the officials associated with Iranian manufacture. The officials claimed that such sophisticated weaponry could not have been assembled by the Shia militia and said that it must have been supplied from neighbouring Iran. The U.S. view is that only a state arms company would have the ability to manufacture weapons of this kind and the officials maintained that the weapons were smuggled in to Iraq by the Qods Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and have estimated that such an operation was known to the Iranian government and encouraged by it, but did not present any evidence to support the claims.\nThe U.S. evidence is being met with close scrutiny, after the experience of pre-Iraq war U.S. intelligence estimates of Saddam Hussein's weapons capability and links with Al-Qaeda, which were found to be inaccurate. When asked why this information was being released at this specific moment, even though the information had accumulated since 2004, the officials explained that they saw a near doubling of EFP attacks in 2006.\nThe U.S. claims that the such weapons have killed at least 170 troops and a much higher number of Iraqi civilians. Secretary Gates said that the EFPs did not form a large proportion of roadside bombs but that they were \"extremely lethal\". Improvised explosive devices have been a big killer of both Iraqi civilians and Allied forces in Iraq. Tens of thousands of civilians and over 3000 Allied troops have died in the nearly four-year-old Iraq war.\nThe exchanges come during a period of heightened tension between Iran and the U. S. over Iran's nuclear programme. The U.S. deployed a second aircraft carrier strike force in the Persian Gulf last month."}

And planners are expecting the population to reach more than 120,000 by 2030. But while downtown booms with people, business is busting. The International Herald Tribune reports that the city\u2019s recently-released jobs and land-use study is estimating that downtown Vancouver may run out of commercial and office space within 5 years. \nThe 'Vancouver problem' is one that many cities in the United States could only hope to have. On the contrary, much effort has been put into bringing residential life back into the city centres. In Los Angeles, San Diego, Miami, and Washington, D.C. there has been a condominium boom in recent years, but these cities are far from the situation Vancouver faces now.\nTo counter the trend in Vancouver, planners are proposing changes to the city\u2019s zoning regulations, including the passage of more lenient building height restrictions. But because residential developments are so much more profitable than commercial and office space, some public officials are proposing offering better incentives to the developers willing to build commercial. Another option is to expand the moratorium that was placed on new housing development in the central business district two years ago. \nTranslink is currently involved in a major expansion of the 49.5 km (30.8 mi) Skytrain system centred on downtown Vancouver.

Shouting anti-Sai Baba slogans, the protestors pulled down a large picture of the holy man and trampled on it before taking it outside and setting it on fire. An effigy of the Baba was also reported to have been burnt, and twenty protestors were arrested following several police complaints.\nResponses.\nThe Baba, who preaches love and universal brotherhood, has several thousands of followers both in India and abroad including several heads of state, politicians, military officials, judges, film stars and sportsmen. Criticism of the Baba's comments have come from several quarters. \nK. Chandrasekhar Rao, leader of the Telangana Rashtra Samithi and former Union Minister, suggested that the Baba should restrict himself to religious functions and not involve himself in politics. \"Otherwise, he should quit religion and join politics,\" Rao said. Congress MP Madhu Yaskhi Goud criticised the Baba for not assisting with the ongoing fluorosis problem in the Telangana region. Poet and Maoist sympathiser Gaddar asked the Baba to \"shut up\".\nSwami Agnivesh, social activist and President of All-India Arya Samaj, voiced his criticism against the Baba for focusing on something \"unnecessary\" instead of speaking out on the recent Nithari killings. \"As he is not a political leader he should not make such comments,\" he said, adding that he intended to write a protest letter to the Baba.\nSai Baba's followers in his home town of Puttaparthi responded by calling a 'bandh' in which shops and business establishments were shut down to protest against the remarks of the Telangana leaders, and effigies of Rao, Goud, and Gaddar were set alight. K. Kesava Rao, President of the Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee, maintained that the Baba's comments had been \"misinterpreted\" and that the remark was not political. \"All that Baba wanted to emphasis was unity and human oneness. But reference to Telangana in his speech was unfortunately misread,\" he said.\nDigvijay Singh, Congress secretary-general disagreed with suggestions that Chief Minister Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy could have instigated the Baba to make his statement, and confirmed that his party approved plans for the creation of a separate Telangana state. \"With due respect to Sai Baba we can say that the work for setting up the second state reorganisation commission will go on,\" he said."}

Further, humans are not believed to have been in that area at that time for the primates to have learned from them by observation.\nMercader suggests that this implies the primates learned to use the tools either independently of humans or else by a common ancestor (of common descent). \nFurther evidence supporting the hypothesis that the hammers were not used by humans includes that the nut residue on the tools are of nuts which were not regularly a part of a human diet.\nMercader elaborates in a prepared statement: \u201cSome of the nuts require a compression force of more than a thousand kilograms to crack. And the idea is to crack the shell but not smash it \u2014 it\u2019s not a simple technique.\u201d [Editorial correction: force is a vector while mass is a scalar.

This could mean that an anti-HIV vaccine is possible in the future. \nAccording to Peter Kwong, researcher at U.S National Institute of Health (NIH), this study is likely to contribute to finding HIV's \"site of vulnerability\" which could then be targeted with a vaccine that prevents the initial infection. \nThe team of researchers have made atomic-level images of HIV and revealed the structure of a protein on the surface of the virus. This protein, called gp120, binds to an infection-fighting antibody and seems to be susceptible to attacks by this antibody called 'b12'. B12 can broadly neutralize the virus. \nResearchers detailed the precise interaction as the virus tries to hook on to and infect cells sent to protect the body. They have captured an image of how the virus of human immunodeficiency attacks the human cells. Dr. Gary Nabel, an NIH vaccine expert and a co-author of the research, describes this first contact between the virus and the cells as a 'cautious handshake' which then becomes a 'hearty bear hug'. The virus grabs and infects the cells that are aimed at protecting the body. \nThen the virus mutates quickly to fight the immune system's attacks as well as to counter the effect of antibodies that block the proteins with help of which HIV binds to a cell to infect it.\nScientists agree that a vaccine against AIDS would be an ideal way to stop the pandemic of this disease, but, with all importance of these findings, much work and studies are still needed. This implies that any vaccine against AIDS is probably still many years away. \nThe AIDS virus has killed more than 25 million people since it was first detected in 1981. Sub-Saharan Africa is the most severely affected by the epidemic. Approximately 40 million people live with HIV.\nAbout a dozen potential vaccines are currently under development.

The location of the find is near the Candor Chasma canyon and images of the cracks were taken in September of 2006.\n\"This result shows how orbital observations can identify features of particular interest for future exploration on the surface or in the subsurface or by sample return. The alteration along fractures, concentrated by the underground fluids, marks locations where we can expect to find key information about chemical and perhaps biologic processes in a subsurface environment that may have been habitable,\" said McEwen.\nAccording to NASA scientists, \"mineralization\" was found on the surface of the cracks and the crack's fractures. Scientists say the minerals became visible after layers of sand and dirt eroded away from the cracks. The minerals were likely placed on the rocks after dissolving in water and then evaporating onto the rocks, causing the minerals to become rock. Another possibility on how the minerals were placed there is that the \"fluid\" circulating on the rock was a gas, which might or might not have contained water.\n\"What caught my eye was the bleaching or lack of dark material along the fracture. That is a sign of mineral alteration by fluids that moved through those joints. It reminded me of something I had seen during field studies in Utah, that is light-tone zones, or 'haloes,' on either side of cracks through darker sandstone,\" said University of Arizona, Tucson geologist, Dr. Chris Okubo.\n\"The haloes visible along fractures seen in the Candor Chasma image appear to be slightly raised relative to surrounding, darker rock. This is evidence that the circulating fluids hardened the lining of the fractures, as well as bleaching it. The harder material would not erode away as quickly as softer material farther from the fractures,\" said a statement on NASA's website.\nIt is not clear how long the minerals might have been present or how long it took them to get on the rocks.\n\"It is hard to say how long ago the fluids were there - hundreds of millions or perhaps a billion years ago. But the fact that we see evidence for chemical reactions between the fluids and the rock means that the fluids were sitting there for quite a long time ... that's perhaps good if you want to look for any habitable areas that might support any biological activity,\" added Okubo.\n\"This publication is just the first of many, many to come. The analysis is based on test observations taken even before the start of our main science phase. Since then, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has returned several terabits of science data, sustaining a pace greater than any other deep space mission. This flood of data will require years of study to exploit their full value, forever increasing our understanding of Mars and its history of climate change,\" added Okubo."}

This finding challenges the common conception that natural methods of birth control are the least effective among all the family planning methods that are available today.\nIn 1985, scientists at University of Heidelberg started a prospective, longitudinal study of 900 women using the symptothermal method for family planning (not compared to another population). The symptothermal method requires a woman to define her fertile interval during the monthly cycle through measuring body temperature and observing cervical secretions. \nIt was found that the lowest pregnancy levels (an average 0.43 pregnancies per 100 women per year, \"i.e.\" 13 cycles, with 95% confidence intervals of 0.05-1.55) were among women who abstained from sex contact or practiced non-penetrative sex during their most fertile period (as defined by the symptothermal method). The rate was slightly higher (0.59 pregnancies per 100 women per year) among women who used barrier methods of contraception (for example, a condom) during the same period.\nThese figures indicate that the symptothermal method might be reliable, but more research is needed to increase the statistical power of the data. Scientists consider a method of contraception to be highly effective if the pregnancy rate is less than one pregnancy per 100 women per year when used properly (the upper limit of confidence was 1.55 in this case, but the average 0.43).\nThe study reported a dropout rate of 9.2 per 100 woman. Study participants indicated that this was either due to the fact that they no longer wished to participate, or that they wanted to achieve pregnancy, for medical reasons, because they separated from their partner, \"etc\".\nSurprisingly enough, the rate of pregnancy among women who had sex during their fertile period turned out to be only 7.46 pregnancies per 100 women per year, although the rate was four times higher than what could be expected. The researchers say these women had sex on the boundaries of their fertile periods.\nTaken together, these findings suggest that the symptothermal method of contraception is worthy of further research, as a possible future option for those who for some physical or religious reasons cannot use other family planning methods.

The pace of the withdrawal \"depends, of course, in part on what we do, what the Iraqi authorities themselves do, but also on the attitude of those we are together fighting,\" according to the prime minister. Over the last weeks, the British have conducted 'operation Sinbad' against Shiite militias in Basra. On Sunday, Blair said in a T.V. interview that the operation was now complete.\nOn Tuesday, an Iraqi Army division in Basra was transferred to Iraqi control. The Ministry of Defence spoke of an \"important step\" toward taking up responsibilities in the area.\nRumours of the pullback had already emerged on Tuesday. A White House spokesperson had stated that \"while the United Kingdom is maintaining a robust force in southern Iraq, we\u2019re pleased that conditions in Basra have improved sufficiently that they are able to transition more control to the Iraqis.\" The press was told that Bush \"sees this as a sign of success and what is possible for us once we help the Iraqis deal with the sectarian violence in Baghdad.\""}

A previously overlooked stretch of DNA on chromosome 11 implicates a gene called neurexin 1 and increases the evidence for the involvement of neurexins and genes related to glutamate transmission in the brain.\nGenetic studies of autism have previously been undertaken; however the new study involves the collaboration of more than 120 scientists from more than 50 institutions representing 19 countries who pooled their data as part of the Autism Genome Project. The findings were published in the Feb. 18 issue of Nature Genetics.\nBob Wright, co-founder of Autism Speaks, a non-profit organization dedicated to increasing awareness of autism, said: \"The identification of susceptibility genes will provide profound new insight into the basis of autism offering a route to breakthroughs in new treatments in support of families.\" Autism Speaks funded this project in conjunction with the U.S. National Institutes of Health.\nJoachim Hallmayer, MD, associate professor of psychiatry at Stanford and chair of the collaboration's executive committee, explains what is next: \u201cWhile promising, these results need to be followed up with more refined genetic maps to home in on other specific candidate genes. We also need to look more closely at chromosomal anomalies in large samples of children with autism.\u201d In the paper, researchers caution that the genetic foundation of autism probably involves multiple genes and chromosomal abnormalities.\nAutism affects about one in every 150 children, and the CDC has called it an \"urgent health concern\". Autism is a developmental disorder which impairs social interaction, communication and features restricted and repetitive interests and activities. Twin studies and other research clearly suggest a genetic basis for the condition. Currently there is no cure for autism, but both behavioral or sensory interventions and drugs can influence the symptoms."}

If so, the humans responsible for the disaster may eventually answer to the over 10,000 former residents of the land currently reduced the world's most unruly mud puddle.\nA consultant for the oil and gas industry is on record saying, \"This is a natural disaster induced by drilling activity...Somehow, or somewhere, several mistakes occurred that caused the mud to come from the hole.\" Since its birth over eight months ago, the mud volcano has expelled as much as 126,000 cubic meters of mud per day. A recent publication of the Geological Society of America has concurred with the earlier assessment.\nThe mud is not toxic, but it smells bad and reaches over 4 meters deep at some points. Entire villages have been filled by the mud flow. Management techniques for the disaster have included diverting the flow into the ocean, which has in turn produced anxieties regarding the potential of ecological damage to the ocean.\nIn an attempt to check the deluge of hot mud, a recent (and contentious) intervention has been placed into motion: the volcano will be plugged. Although the plan seems cartoonish, Rudi Novrianto -- spokesman for the national mudflow disaster commission -- is on record saying, \"We will insert high density chained balls inside the mud volcano. This technique is expected to reduce the amount of mud flow and ease the pressure at the source of the gushing.\"\nThe obvious possibility of pressure buildup, and a secondary (and more violent) mud eruption, has been addressed. Richard Davies of Durham university is on record stating \"...nobody has ever done this before...the pressure may build, forcing open other vents, possibly exacerbating the situation.\""}

Telecom has temporarily stopped either new or existing customers from signing up to the new plan, and will also ask existing customers in the next couple of weeks if they wish to change plans, stay on the same plan with a changed traffic management policy, or cancel their service.\nThe credit, automatically applied to the affected customers monthly bill, will cost Telecom itself around $7.5-$8.5 million.\nKevin Bowler, general manager of Telecom's consumer marketing, said that the traffic management policy process was found to be not what they had originally intended it to do. The fault applied to all forms of Internet use, instead of certain applications, like large music, or movie downloading. \"Clearly it is not an ideal situation and therefore we are crediting Go Large customers for plan charges incurred during this period.\"\n\"In this instance with the Go Large plan our internal technical review showed we had made an error and we believe that we are doing the right thing by crediting customers,\" Mr Bowler said.\nNew Zealand's Commerce Commission has been investigating complaints by customers who say that they are not receiving what Xtra promised since the same time when Xtra initiated its traffic management policy, December. Deborah Battell, fair trading director, said that the Commerce Commission is pleased Telecom is crediting customers for its error. \"However, the Commission is concerned that Telecom's actions may not address the full extent of the problems. The Commission will continue its investigation into whether the promotion breached the Fair Trading Act. In particular, the Commission is considering whether Telecom's initial representation that Go Large gave customers unlimited access was misleading, as the company's reasonable use policy in effect placed limits on use.\"\nThe reasonable use policy meant subscribers could not download BitTorrents, or use other peer-to-peer services without giving priority Internet access to other subscribers.\nErnie Newman, chief executive of the Telecommunications User Association of New Zealand (TUANZ), said that it is good that Telecom is to repay its subscribers for their own error, but says that it will diminish their trust in Telecom, and other phone companies. \"We applaud their openness. But sadly it is another episode in a chain of events where customers have signed up for broadband services that were advertised as offering attractive speeds or data limits, but in reality have delivered a whole lot less.\"\n\"Something in Telecom needs to change. There have been too many disappointments, too much over-promising and under-delivering. This simply adds to the concern of many people that when it comes to the impact of broadband on customers lives and businesses, Telecom has not yet got the message,\" Mr Newman said."}

Richardson's team found a peak in the infrared spectra and was able to determine that the atmosphere of HD 209458 b likely consisted of clouds of silicate dust. Dr. Mark Swain of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory led another study of HD 209458 b, and found similar results.\nAnother team, led by Dr. Carl Grillmair of Spitzer Science Center at Caltech, performed a similar study of HD 189733b, 63 light-years away, in the constellation Vulpecula. Dr. Grillmair discusses the results: \u201cIt was believed to be fairly straightforward that these planets would have a lot of water in them, for one thing, very hot water. These planets, these hot Jupiters very, very close in to their parent stars are 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit or so, so it's not a pleasant place to live. And what we found instead and what the other group found for this completely different planet around another star, is that the spectrum is essentially flat. It really doesn\u2019t show any of the features we would have expected from water.\u201d\n\"The theorists' heads were spinning when they saw the data,\" adds Dr. Richardson. \"It is virtually impossible for water, in the form of vapor, to be absent from the planet, so it must be hidden, probably by the dusty cloud layer we detected in our spectrum.\"\nDr. Grillmair: \"The observations are showing us that things are not the way we expected them. And so there'll be a big push to get a lot more data while Spitzer is still alive. I think this will ultimately be one of the most important legacies of the Spitzer Space Telescope, unanticipated as it was before launch. I think it will become extremely important in the future.\" The telescope was launched in August of 2003 with a maximum expected life cycle of 5 years. \n\"With these new observations, we are refining the tools that we will one day need to find life elsewhere if it exists,\" said Swain. \"It's sort of like a dress rehearsal.\"\nDr. Swain's and Dr. Grillmair's studies are pending publication in Astrophysical Journal Letters."}

The hit caused the co-captain to fall to the ice, stunned, with a possible concussion. Drury is said to be out for an undetermined amount of time.\nShortly after Drury was escorted off the ice, Adam Mair of the Sabres hit Jason Spezza of the Senators just before the face-off following the incident with Drury which sparked the fight between all of the 12 players on both teams, including both goalies, Martin Biron of the Sabres and Ray Emery of the Senators, who were both thrown out of the game. Emery had just returned to the ice rink after he was suspended for three games when he slashed Maxim Lapierre of the Montreal Canadians.\nDuring the physical brawl with the players, both coaches Ruff and Murray were yelling at each other and at one point Ruff began to jump over walls separating the two teams from the penalty boxes however neither of the coaches ended up in a physical brawl.\n\"When something like that happens to one of your star players, you have to respond. The players did the right thing. You can't respond any other way,\" said Ruff in regards to the brawl between the players.\nMurray accuses Ruff of sending several players to the ice in what he says was the initiation of the fight.\n\"I put out skill players and he sends out the five guys on his team that are going to start a fight,\" said Murray.\nRuff first denied that he sent players to the ice to start the fight saying \"I'm not going to comment on what I had on my mind\" in a press conference after the game, but then said he said \"go out and run 'em.\"\nAs a result of the brawl, these penalties were handed out:\nThe Sabres ended up winning the game 6-5 in a shootout when the only goal of the shootout was scored by Drew Stafford of the Sabres.\nThe Sabres and Senators will play their final game of the season between each other on Saturday February 24 at 7:00 p.m. [EST]."}

Witnesses said that several passengers have broken bones. All but one carriage have slid down the embankment and all of the carriages were derailed. 5 people are still seriously injured in hospital, including the driver Ian Black, and 11 people altogether are still in hospital. Hospital reports early on Saturday morning indicate 1 death, 84 year old lady Margaret Masson from Glasgow.\n\"It's our understanding there are a number of people injured on the train. We think there are numerous injuries,\" said a spokesman for the Cumbria Fire and Rescue squad, Brian Mitchelhill.\n\"A train has crashed between Oxenholme and Tebay, but that is all we know at the moment. We have got two cars travelling there now and local police are attending,\" said a spokeswoman for the British Transport Police.\nAt least twelve ambulances and at least five fire trucks are at the scene, along with 3 Royal Air Force Sea King helicopters, two mountain rescue teams and one police helicopter. The rescue effort was hampered by limited access to the remote site and poor weather conditions. \n\"At the moment, we have reports of various injuries, from leg injuries to back injuries and head injuries -- ranging from minor to quite serious,\" said an unnamed ambulance official.\n\"The carriage I am in is completely on its side, it did a sort of bump - and I was thinking don't worry this fine - but then the swaying became very dramatic,\" said a BBC executive, Caroline Thomson. \"Where I am there are some injuries - a woman with a very badly hurt back but I suspect further up the train it's a bit more serious.\"\nFirst reports suggested that the train hit something on the track at 20:15 near Grayrigg, between Oxenholme and Tebay, derailed and slid down an embankment. Early investigators reports say a set of points will be the primary focus of the investigation. All but one of the train's carriages are said to have totally come off the tracks, a spokeswoman said. \nSo far 12 passengers have been taken to The Royal Preston Hospital, where three casualties are said to be in a \"critical condition\" and one serious. 3 passengers with limb injuries are at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary. People with minor injuries were taken to a nearby farm before being transferred to a Kendal hotel.\nAs of 22:16, Sleeper services over the affected line have been suspended. Other major services are terminating at Preston or Carlisle according to (UK) National Rail Enquires. A five mile cordon has been set up to seal the crash site as investigators from the Rail Accident Investigation Branch attempt to determine the cause of the crash.\nVirgin owner Richard Branson came to the site from his holiday in Switzerland and held a press conference at a safe distance, roughly 200 meters, from the site. Branson stated that the Virgin Train Pendolino was \"built like a tank\", and believed the track was to blame. All of the carriages retained their integrity and none of the windows broke. Mr Branson also praised the driver of the train for attempting to stop the train and not leaving the cockpit.\nNetwork Rail has checked 700 sets of rail points in response to the accident, though no speed restrictions have been imposed."}

Samuel Weiss and V. Wee Yong of the Hotchkiss Brain Institute, compared virgin and pregnant mice with MS-like lesions introduced by lysolecithin, a chemical which destroys the myelin sheaths around neurons. They found the pregnant mice developed smaller lesions and fewer damaged neurons, and showed signs of repaired neurons. They also found the pregnant mice had higher levels of cells called oligodendrocytes, which create myelin and are able to repair some damaged neurons through remyelination. Because prolactin regulates the levels of precursors of oligodendrocytes, the scientists hypothesized that prolactin levels were responsible for the differences in damage. They also tested virgin mice given additional prolactin, and found results similar to pregnant mice.\nPrevious studies have shown that other hormones could reduce myelin damage, but this is the first study to show a mechanism to reverse myelin damage, and establish an empirical connection between that mechanism and pregnancy. Dr. Weiss says, \u201cIt is thought that during pregnancy, women\u2019s immune systems no longer destroyed the myelin. However, no previous study has tested whether pregnancy actually results in the production of new myelin, which may lead to improvement of symptoms. \"We're excited about this result because it suggests to us that prolactin has the potential to be used to enhance the production of new myelin.\u201d\nDr. William McIlroy, national medical advisor for the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada, explains the significance of this study: \u201cThe results of this study should be well received by people living with MS today. It represents a new insight of how we might be able to reverse some of the effects of the disease and improve the quality of life for those who live under its influence.\u201d \nDr. Luanne Metz, director of the Calgary MS Clinic in the Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary and Calgary Health Region, adds, \u201cThis discovery has the potential to take MS therapy a step further than current treatments that stabilize the disease in its early stages. By promoting repair, which is the goal of prolactin therapy, we have hope of actually improving symptoms in people with MS.\u201d\nFurther animal studies need to be done to examine the possibility of side effects, such as lactation in men and non-pregnant women, as well as increased inflammation which could worsen the MS. Researchers believe human trials may begin within a few years.\nFunding and support were provided by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada, the Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research and the Stem Cell Network.\nMS is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system where the body attacks the fatty myelin which helps nerves carry electrical signals, causing muscle weakness and spasming which may lead to disability. MS affects approximately one of every 1000 people in North America, northern Europe and Australasia."}

We won't make money that way. We need new subscribers.\" Likewise, XM executives say they can't succeed by stealing Sirius subscribers. This leaves both companies with the problem of attracting new customers and distinguishing their brand, while at the same time trying to convince potential customers to pay $12.95 a month for radio, something that people are used to getting for free. Even if one company were to force the other out of the marketplace, the remaining company would have won a Pyrrhic victory, without enough capital remaining to take advantage of the situation.\nThe solution: make a deal now, while both companies are both strong and in a position to expand their technologies and services. That's exactly what they plan to do: In press releases and news postings on both of their web sites, both companies have pledged to make the combined company better than either service by itself. \"You've heard of 1+1=3,\" Karmazin said during an invester conference call, \"that's what this is.\"\nPending approval of the deal, each share of XM stock will be replaced with 4.6 shares of Sirius. Each company's stockholders will retain approximately 50% of the joined company. Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin will retain his CEO title in the new company, and XM chairman Gary Parsons will retain his. XM CEO Hugh Panero will retain his position until the merger is complete, which should happen near the end of 2007. \nOpposition.\nSeveral consumer and community groups have come out in opposition to the merge. \nSupport.\nIn the initial merger press release, Sirius and XM asserted that satellite radio is part of the audio entertainment industry rather than an industry of its own, and as such competes with traditional terrestrial radio, HD Radio, iPods and on-line radio. The resultant company will be subject to regulation pre- and post-merger by the FCC, Federal Trade Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, Department of Justice and possibly other federal organizations. The FCC has issued a statement saying that a merger is not without its hurdles, and that they will want assurances that price, quality, and consumer choice will be protected.\nBased on C3SR's blog posts and Internet forum posts on various fan sites, it is apparent that many subscribers are looking forward to the deal. Speculation abounds on what the new receivers will look like, and how customers' existing hardware will fit in to the new plan. \nWhile many of the facts concerning the merger are not yet known: what the new company will be called, exactly which programming the new company will carry, and when customers will need to upgrade their hardware, one thing is for certain: Satellite radio in North America is in for one big change.\nFurther reading.\nWe will follow the progress of the merger in .

Van Der Sar earned his money this day, as he was forced into another spectacular save after a Brian McBride shot was aimed for the bottom corner, but was denied by the Dutchman. With the clock winding down, United began to pressure, and Christiano Ronaldo had an inspired run, beating out three defenders, and lashing the ball into the bottom right corner of the net, past Jan Lastuvka, giving the Red Devils a 2 - 1 lead with only 2 minutes remaining in normal time.

These program cuts are resisted by many former and current VOA journalists who see them as a dangerous departure from VOA's mission to support press freedom worldwide. The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) - a bipartisan body managing VOA and other U.S. international broadcasts - plans to expand news coverage to the Middle East, North Korea and Latin America by eliminating or reducing programs to Russia, Tibet, China, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and a number of other media-at-risk countries. Acting with apparent approval from the White House, the BBG also want to eliminate VOA's flagship English radio broadcast News Now. \nFormer and current VOA journalists who have criticized the BBG's plans as a betrayal of VOA's support for media freedom are circulating two online petitions asking the U.S. Congress to stop the proposed program cuts.\nOne of the petitions specifically opposes the planned elimination of VOA Uzbek radio broadcasts by pointing out that Uzbekistan's ruler Islam Karimov has effectively silenced political opposition and eliminated or forced underground nearly all independent media outlets. \nThis is the second time the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) - bipartisan body in charge of U.S. international broadcasts - is trying to eliminate VOA radio programs to Uzbekistan. The BBG had stopped VOA Uzbek radio programs once before, in August 2004, but the pressure from the U.S. Congress and human rights groups forced the BBG to resume them in June 2005. \nThis year the BBG is again trying to end VOA radio presence in Uzbekistan and in a number of other countries. In addition to VOA Uzbek radio programs, the BBG is planning to eliminate or reduce U.S. taxpayer-funded broadcasts to Kazakhstan, Russia, Tibet and China -- countries whose regimes were declared by the Paris-based nongovernmental organization Reporters Without Borders (RSF) as major violators of media freedom and freedom of expression. Uzbekistan's leader Islam Karimov, Russia's President Vladimir Putin, Kazakhstan's authoritarian ruler Nursultan Nazarbayev and China's leader Hu Jintao have been all called by Reporters Without Borders \"Predators of Press Freedom.\"\nThe second online petition initiated by a former VOA Associate Director Ted Lipien focuses on the BBG plans to eliminate VOA Russian radio broadcasts. The petition asks the U.S. Congress to reject the proposed cuts and demand from the White House and the BBG a consistent U.S. international broadcasting strategy in support of freedom.\nFreeMediaOnline.org, a California-based nonprofit group founded to support freedom of the press worldwide, described these proposed cuts and reductions in U.S. international broadcasting as nothing less than a \"gift to dictators and suppressors of press freedom.\" FreeMediaOnline.org believes that \"this lack of consistency sends a terrible signal to defenders of freedom and courageous journalists around the world. Some of them, like independent Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, paid with their lives for exposing human rights violations. To make their voices heard, they have relied on VOA Russian radio programs which the White House and the BBG plan to eliminate.\" \nAccording to the BBG, some program cuts are necessary to fund expansion of U.S. broadcasts to Iran and to other major Muslim countries and regions. Critics such as FreeMediaOnline.org activists have pointed out, however, that there are many other noncritical programs within the U.S. international broadcasting bureaucracy controlled by the BBG. They maintain that reducing these support programs instead could easily pay for new programming to the Middle East and for the much needed enhancement and modernization of programs and program delivery to countries like Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Russia, and China.\nVOA first broadcast on shortwave to Nazi Germany February 24, 1942, just weeks after the United States entered World War Two. In that broadcast, news announcer William Harlan Hale told listeners, \"The news may be good. The news may be bad. We shall tell you the truth.\"\nVOA Director Dan Austin says although the technology of broadcasting may have changed in the intervening years, the Voice of America's adherence to its core mission remains the same. He says the agency will continue to honestly and accurately report the news. Austin did not address the issue of the program cuts demanded by the BBG and how they might affect VOA's mission. He was appointed to his position as VOA Director by the BBG. "}

The rocket was later reported not be designed to reach an orbit. Iran claims it reached an altitude of 94 miles and then parachuted home. No images have been released, and no other reports have confirmed the launch.\nThe announcement comes at a time of international tension over Iran's nuclear program. In a speech today, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad compared his country's nuclear program with a train with no brakes and no reverse gear. Manouchehr Mohammadi, a deputy foreign minister, said the country had prepared itself for a standoff over its nuclear activities. Diplomats said that if Iran would possess advanced missile capabilities it would be of concern to the nations who believe Iran is developing nuclear weapons, something Iran denies.\nThe head of the Iranian space center, Mohsen Bahrami, was quoted saying that the scientific material on board came from the science and from the defence ministry. He also said that the test was in line with international regulations on the matter. Although the news would mean a significant breakthrough for Iran's missile technology, the story was only mentioned during one TV broadcast, and not at all by other official Iranian media.\nIran has said in the past it wants more satellites to increase its cellular phone and internet capabilities. It also said it hopes to become a center for science and technology in the region.\nSince 2005, Iran already has one satellite in space, Sinah-1, which was launched in Russia with a Russian rocket. The rocket was described as serving telecommunication and research purposes. Soon after the 2005 launch, Iran announced they would develop their own launcher. Yesterday, the Iranian Defence Minister spoke of Iran's plans for their own satellite launcher, and disclosed his country's desire to join the club of countries with a space program."}

Chelsea fielded a full strength side, including Andriy Shevchenko, Michael Ballack, Didier Drogba, and skipper John Terry. Arsenal on the other hand fielded a young side, including Theo Walcott, Cesc Fabregas, Jeremie Aliadiere, and Justin Hoyte.\nDespite their apparent lack of experience, Arsenal started out the match strongly, with crisp passing and great control. They pressed their advantage, and forced Chelsea keeper Petr Cech into several saves. On 12 minutes, Theo Walcott struck gold, as he orcestrated a give and go with Abou Diaby and slotted the ball into the far corner of the net, scoring his first ever goal for the Gunners. Soon after, Baptista of Arsenal had a legitimate claim for a penalty, but referee Howard Webb wouldn't hear of it. Chelsea struck back quickly, and a hint of offside was shown as Didier Drogba was played in by an over the top ball by Michael Ballack. The Ivory Coast striker didn't wait for a whistle, and slotted the ball between Manuel Almunia's legs to tie the match. A few more chances were spurned due to poor finishing before the break, but the game went into halftime drawn at one a piece.\nThe second half started much as the first, with the youthful exuberance of Arsenal showing through, as they continued to press. Chelsea's output was increased as well however, with the addition of Arjen Robben at the exspense of Makelele. 2 yellow cards were handed out to Chelsea in the next few minutes, before the game took a huge downturn. Chelsea skipper John Terry was seriously injured, when Diaby's foot connected squarly with his face as Diaby attempted to clear the ball. Terry was taken off in a stretcher and was replaced by Mikel. The loss of their captain seemed to push Chelsea to new levels, as Drogba forced a fine save out of Almunia, and Lampard saw his shot go off the woodwork. Arsenal were not able to hold on, and on 81 minutes, Denilson made a sloppy pass and Robben picked up the scraps. He sent a cross in as Drogba beat Senderos to the ball and headed in his 28th of the campaign. The blue tide continued, and Shevchenko blasted a ball off the woodwork, missing his chance to seal the victory.\nAs the game entered stoppage time, Mikel and Toure entered a shoving match, and more players got involved. Coaches took the field to attempt to settle their players, and when all was finally calm, Mikel and Toure were shown red cards, along with Adebayor of Arsenal. The game was finally called at 101 minutes, and stand in skipper Lampard was able to hoist the Carling Cup."}

Alan Greenspan indicated on Monday that the U.S. economy would not sustain its recent growth, where the Dow Industrials set day-to-day records and the White House signaled on Tuesday that it would revise its estimate of fourth-quarter 2006 GDP growth down to an annual rate of about 2.3 percent from an initial forecast of 3.5 percent and was increasingly nervous that the figure could come in even lower.\nAround 3 p.m. EST, \"Reuters\" reported that the New York Stock Exchange had implemented on-floor tradition restrictions meant to curb the sell off.\nThe decline also occurred on the day that a plot to assassinate U.S. Vice President Richard Cheney failed in Afghanistan."}

We didn't receive press releases or scripts in advance of events happening.\"\nAt the heart of the controversy is a video that surfaced on Google Video and YouTube. It is a segment taken from the BBC's own archive of their news coverage of the events of September 11. In it, reporter Jane Standley reports the complete unexpected collapse of WTC 7. However, she presented this information half an hour before it actually happened. In fact, while she is reporting the demise of WTC 7, it is clearly visible right behind her. During the course of the broadcast, the studio loses the connection with her, and when she returns, the building is gone.\nDuring the first part of the broadcast, she gives specific details about the building, how many floors it has, who owns &amp; leases it, and the fact that nobody was inside at the time of the collapse. All of these facts that Ms. Standley presented were 100% accurate.\nIn Porter's 5-point response to the accusations, he insists that his organization was the victim of chaos, not conspiracy. Unfortunately, Porter says, none of the reporters involved remember exactly what happened, and they have lost all of the original archive tapes, making it impossible to check. Porter explains that \"like everybody else that day she was trying to make sense of what she was seeing; what she was being told; and what was being told to her by colleagues in London who were monitoring feeds and wires services.\"\nHe concludes that, at worst, they simply made an error \u2014 an error that happened to be prophetic. He signs off by quoting a flippant comment from YouTube: \"so the guy in the studio didn't quite know what was going on? Woah, that totally proves conspiracy... \".\nDirectly beneath Porter's blog are two-dozen comments from BBC News readers. The comments are less than appreciative."}

An examination of more than 7,000 teenagers revealed that those who had their first sexual experience earlier than their peers showed a 20 percent increase in delinquent conduct a year after. \nStacy Armour, a research student from Ohio State University, who took part in the study found a correlation between teens beginning their sex life later than their peers and their subsequent rate of delinquency. The research showed that adolescents who were late to begin sex life as compared to the average age of teens in their school, were 50 percent more unlikely to act delinquently.\nThe average age when adolescents begin their sex life would be between 11.25 and 17.5 years, according to the research that is found in Journal of Youth and Adolescence. The information concerning the average age of teenagers who just had their first intercourse was revealed for each of the schools that took part in the study. Every respondent had his data compared with the data of other peers within one school. \nThe overall data of the study revealed that a 58 percent increase in delinquent behavior was pronounced among those teenagers who stopped claiming to be virgins between first and second study. The research itself doesn't suggest that sex is interrelated with delinquency but it raises the problem that those teenagers who are more impatient to start sexual life are likely to show asocial behavior later.

The previous game was played to a 0 - 0 draw, with defensive strength showing on Blackburn's side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This game went much the same way, with Arsenal controlling the game, but not delivering any potent strikes. Arsenal had an appeal for a penalty when keeper Brad Friedel brought down Jermie Aliadiere in the box, but referee Graham Poll dubbed the challenge fair. Arsenals best chance came through Julio Baptista, who tried to head in a Denilson free kick, but the attempt sailed over the crossbar, not troubling Brad Friedel. Blackburn had their own chance on 53 minutes, but Morten Gamst Pederson's shot flew wide of the post after he did well to make space in the box. 10 minutes later, Blackburn made two substitutions, putting Benni McCarthy and David Dunn into the match at the exspense of Tugay and Nonda. Arsenal made a change several minutes later, as Clich replaced Traore. Baptista continued to threaten the Blackburn goal, but a great save from Friedel and a misplaced header kept the game tied. As the game drew close to extra time, Benni McCarthy produced a wonderful goal, as he beat out Senderos and curled the ball into the top left corner. Arsenal attempted to strike back, but they left it too late, as Blackburn advanced to the next round.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nBlackburn will play Manchester City in the next round of the FA Cup."}

The representatives challenged the merger deal, and some speakers were openly hostile to Karmazin and to satellite radio in general, while other speakers were more civil.\nSeveral times during the debate, the discussion centered on the failed merger deal between the two satellite television networks DirecTV and Echostar. The comparison between this proposed radio merger and the failed television merger was settled to some extent with an understanding that nearly all television viewers now use either cable or satellite to view available programming. Televised programming content is now delivered mainly in the form of a subscription, rather than airwave transmissions.\nUnlike television programming, most radio listeners use over the air receivers to listen to free programming content supported advertisers.\n\"We come to this hearing with an open mind, but we recognize that the companies have the obligation to convince the Congress, the regulators, and most importantly, the American People that this combination will improve the competitive playing field and benefit consumers,\" said John Conyers, the sub-committee chairman. To determine the legality of this merger, Congress first needs to decide whether a combined XM and Sirius would be a monopoly, as the only satellite radio provider in the United States, or whether the new company will actually be in competition with other forms of radio-like entertainment, according to Conyers. The hearing focused on alternatives such as Internet radio, terrestrial radio, portable audio devices, and emerging services, such as cell phone services and WiMax.\nThe Issue.\nAt the heart of the debate is whether the two competing satellite services could drive each other to improve both of their services, or whether the proposed merger could result in end-user cost reductions by making more money available for Research &amp; Development, new content, and subscription price reductions.\nHighlights.\nDavid Rehr.\nDavid Rehr, president of the National Association of Broadcasters, spoke first. In a speech riddled with loaded terms like \"government sanctioned monopoly\" and \"government bailout\", he laid out points:\nRerh accused Sirius and XM of breaking promises and asserted that neither company can be trusted. To trust the new, combined company would be stupid, he alleged.\nGigi Sohn.\nGigi Sohn of Public Knowledge presented a more balanced view. On one hand, consolidation will raise questions about price and choice. On the other hand, XM and Sirius have engaged in a spending war, harming both companies financially. She also proposed conditions to protect consumer choice, such as public radio and educational programming requirements. Touching on the Recording Industry Association of America lawsuit, she also stated that consumers should be allowed to record programming.\nMark Cooper.\nMark Cooper spoke on behalf of the Consumer Federation of America. \"We have not given up on competition,\" Cooper said. Like David Rehr, he pointed out the restriction by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) against merging the two licenses. He believed the distinction between satellite and terrestrial radio makes satellite a unique market, where satellite radio is mobile and nationwide, and is not content-regulated. He also touched on the conditions of entry into the FCC market, \"Four is few and six is many, we only have two in this market.\"\nCooper also brought up \"inter-modal competition\" (competition between services that offer similar, but not the same products.) According to him, inter-modal competition has a poor track record of keeping down costs and increasing product quality. \nCooper was extremely outspoken against a \"regulated monopoly\", and said \"consumers are better served by competition.\"\nCharles Biggio.\nCharles Biggio has a history in anti-trust regulation. He advocating finding more facts regarding the merger. His argument focused around Section 7 of the Clayton Act (see section 18.) Unlike other speakers, he did not have an agenda to pursue, but rather spoke specifically on government regulations.\nMel Karmazin.\nMel Karmazin spoke on behalf of both XM and Sirius. Karmazin made several points and promises:\nOther monopolies.\nHoward Berman (D-California 28th District) made a profound remark: \"As I listen to Mr. Rehr's testimony, and when he was talking about merged entities that controlled many radio markets, I thought for a second he was talking about ClearChannel.\" The media company ClearChannel holds a considerable stake in the broadcast bandwidth in the United States.\nDiversity.\nHouse Representative Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) asked about diversity, wondering how the new company would create opportunites for minority ownership and minority involvement in the company's broadcasting? \nKarmazin responded that Sirius and XM have several channels aimed at the African American community: music, entertainment, and talk channels. He noted that each network also carries Spanish-language channels. \nTo the impression that the combined stations would provide for minority-oriented programming, Karmazin explained that news and talk feeds were simply picked up from existing TV and radio networks, which left Rep Lee apparently unconvinced that their interests would be served.\nConclusions.\nAs a debate, this session did not definitevly resolve any issues, and more debate will be necessary. However, it did reveal some interesting facts and motivations:\nThe merger faces more lobbying and politicizing of this issue as the proposal moves forward.\nSources.\nC-SPAN \"House Committe Hearing on the XM and Sirius merger (Real Player webcast)\" February 28, 2007"}

He presented a new education system that could reduce the rate of high school dropouts. Boisclair also presented other ideas to University students.\nA recent poll by Montreal based newspaper \"Le Devoir\", on the 27 of February, shows the Parti Quebecois at 28% and the governing party Parti lib\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec at 37%.

United fielded a strong side including Larsson, Ronaldo, and Rooney, and Liverpool matched their lineup with Kuyt, Gerrard and Bellamy taking to the pitch. Speculation said manager Rafa Benitez would rest his star players for the upcoming Barcelona match, but the Spanish manager proved otherwise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nLiverpool came out strong, not giving any ground to league leaders United. Early strikes by Agger and Riise looked promising, but most efforts sailed wide of the net. Christiano Ronaldo had several chances for United, but his shots also were off target. Craig Bellamy was especially threatening for Liverpool, as he continually outplayed defender Nemanja Vidic, and sent several crosses into the middle, none causing any damage to the Red Devils. Ronaldo had a strong run down the right side, but timely defending by Carragher stopped him in his tracks, as well as another chance by Wayned Rooney.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nIn the second half, Liverpool was again looking dominant, as shots from Gerrard, Bellamy, and Kuyt all flew in, but again no results come of the dominant play. Bellamy then appeared to have gained the lead for the home side, but the goal was deemed offside, as Sissoko took an extra touch before the ball reached the Welshman. Manchester then made an attacking change, putting Saha in place of Larsson, who was playing his last game for United before heading back to Sweeden. Rooney was then forced to be changed after a high foot from Carragher produced a gash in his knee, and the young Englishman was replaced by O'Shea. Riise again challenged Van Der Sar's goal with a long distance shot, but the ball dipped over the crossbar and out of play. Saha had an appeal for a penalty after a challenge by Agger left him on the ground, but the referee gave no call. As Liverpool left the zone, Paul Scholes appeared to take a swipe at the head of Xavi Alonso with his fist, and was subsenquently red carded, leaving United with 10 men. Liverpool continued to attack, and Peter Crouch had plenty of room to strike in a half volley from 8 yards, but Edwin Van Der Sar produced a fingertip save to keep the game tied. As the game entered stoppage time, Ryan Giggs earned a free kick on the edge of the Liverpool penalty box, and Christiano Ronaldo lined up for the kick. Jose Reina was not able to hold onto Ronaldo's powerful kick, and the ball popped out to John O'Shea, who slammed the ball into the top of the net, giving 10 man United the lead. Liverpool tried in vain to tie the match, as Ronaldo wasted time with his tricks and turns. When the 4 minutes of stoppage time were up, the game continued, and Liverpool earned a corner. Brazilian Aurelio took the corner, but it was poor and as Rio Ferdinand cleared the ball, Martin Atkinson blew the whistle to condemn Liverpool to their first home defeat in the Premier League this season.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe game leaves Manchester United 12 points ahead of 2nd place Chelsea, who have 2 games in hand and play later today against Portsmouth. Liverpool on the other hand will regroup for the second leg of their Champions League match against Barcelona. "}

The babies, who were being cared for in the neonatal intensive care unit of Madrid's \"12 de Octubre\" Hospital, all died after being infected with \"Klebsiella pneumoniae\" bacterium. Authorities also suspect that a fourth baby has become infected with the bacterium. The Spanish patients' association ADEPA has asked the public prosecutor of the Madrid Region, Manuel Moix, to open an investigation into the matter.\nThis morning, hospital authorities stated that the first death occurred on 26 February. A baby born eight weeks prematurely and weighing just under one kilo died due to septic shock arising from the infection, which was unconnected with the symptoms of his premature birth, according to hospital reports.\nShortly afterwards, two babies in the same unit died on 2 March. They appear to have died from the same infection; however the hospital stated that they are still waiting for confirmation of the cause of death. A fourth baby has been found to have the bacteria on his skin, but as yet there is no confirmation of whether he has been infected. The hospital states that although the baby is in a serious condition, this is to be expected when a baby is born so premature, and that his condition is also due to other factors, unrelated to the bacterium, which have arisen since his birth.\nThe hospital authorities have asserted that all of the babies in its care are under close supervision, and are being periodically monitored by the Preventive Medicine Centre, in order that the most up-to-date information may be had on the state of any and all patients in the hospital. \nTo prevent further infections, the hospital has taken several measures. The first is of course rigorous medical hygiene. High-risk patients are referred to other hospitals. The hospital has been divided into two separate zones, one for those already infected and the other for those who have not yet been affected. As a consequence, 25 children who were staying in the hospital while the 3 premature babies died, remain separate from the others, to make sure newly admitted children are not exposed. The nursing staff has also been restricted to one or other of these two areas. Visits from specialists of other hospital services, and from families, has been restricted. Furthermore, an epidemiological study is being undertaken to determine the origin of the situation.\nThe newspaper \"El Pa\u00eds\" reports that the bacterium \"Klebsiella pneumoniae\" is to be found in hospitals as a matter of course and is often contracted by those who have been in hospital for prolonged periods (termed a nosocomial infection). The mortality rate from the bacterium is extremely high in those cases where it's contracted by people with serious illnesses, as is often to be expected in the case of a premature birth, which can result in newborn babies weighing less than 500 grammes.\nAccording to the Spanish daily, this type of bacterium is prevalent in hospitals throughout the world, but the incidence of infection in Madrid hospitals is lower than the Spanish average. The head of the Neonatal Unit at 12 de Octubre Hospital, Carmen Pay\u00e1s, explained that the bacterium is very adaptable \"and keeps on learning\". The father of the dead baby, an Ecuadorian named Angel Marcelo, was quoted as saying that the progress of the baby had at first been \"tremendous\", and that he had even been taken off the respirator, but that a few days later he began to cough up blood, dying soon afterwards.\nThe chair of ADEPA, Carmen Flores, has appealed to the Madrid public prosecutor to open an investigation into the situation and to find those responsible. ADEPA have suggested that the investigation centre on the number of casualties among infants in the hospital, and on the question of whether conditions in the neonatal unit were a direct contributor to the incidence of the infection.\nJos\u00e9 Quero, head of the Neonatology Department of the La Paz hospital in Madrid said that, \"sadly enough\", this situation was \"not something exceptional,\" but rather something neonatologists have to watch out for."}

Reinado escaped during a mass breakout from a Dili jail last August.\nAfter the Australian-led operation started, many conflicts occurred simultaneously in different parts of Dili, with roads being barricaded and cut off by burning tires, rocks and trees. Many houses and vehicles were also burned, as violence between rival groups started on the streets.\nThe Vila Verde neighborhood, right in the center of Dili, was one of the most affected, with facilities of the Education Ministry being engulfed by a fire until the morning.\nBenjamin Marty, finance manager for the Norwegian Council for Refugees in East Timor, has his house and office in Vila Verde, in the same street that connects the Portuguese Corporation Neighborhood to the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) headquarters.\n\"I didn't get too worried when a saw a group of people starting to hit the gate, but I called my boss, that said me to stay calm.\" Bryn Bithell-Marty said.\n\"Ten minutes later, I see the GNR arrive and starting to fire rubber bullets to the right and to the left\" of the street, Marty remembered.\n\"They called and asked me to open the gate, but initially I didn't understood what they wanted, because I don't speak Portuguese. Just in some minutes, I was inside a armored vehicle, and we got out of there at the same speed that they had arrived, deviating from the barricades with a lot of skill\", Marty added.\nBenjamin Marty said he was \"surprised with the professionalism\" with which the Portuguese Republican National Guard (GNR) acted, but he was discontented with members of the United Nations Police (UNPol).\n\"There's UNPol near my house, the patrol cars were always stopped and the police agents didn't do anything\u00bb, Marty said, adding that the UNPol agents also didn't react \"hours early when some people started to burn tires and hitting metal to call other people to the street\".\nThe clashes in Taibessi, Pit\u00e9 neighbourhood, and at the entrance of the UNMIT headquarters were the most severe, involving firearms in some locations.\nIn Banana Road, one of the main roads that crosses the city, a group of teenagers guarded a poster of Alfredo Reinado.\n\"We are the defenders of Major Alfredo, hero of the justice. We are ready to die to defend him\", said one of them.\nIn the streets of Taibessi since some days ago that the illumination posts and some trees have posters and banners of Alfredo Reinado.\nAs a response to the successive attacks by a group on the Pit\u00e9 neighborhood, 15 Portuguese Public Security Police (PSP) officers, organized themselves without orders from the UNPol, and for three hours the 15 officers faced the attacks.\nLater back at the GNR headquarters, Benjamin Marty, found himself even more surprised. \"Do you know how the Asterix and Obelix stories end?\" he said. On the GNR headquarters there wasn't a party with roasted boars, like in the Gaul village, \"but there was a cow in the skewer\", he added.\nAll of the three GNR operational platoons then left their monthly festivity to the streets of Dili, for a operation that lasted seven hours."}

Sources said that the $1.5bn fine, the largest ever awarded in a patent case, took into account the number of computers sold pre-installed with the Microsoft Windows operating system since May 2003.\nThe verdict - which Microsoft has confirmed it intends to appeal - could have implications far beyond Microsoft's Redmond, WA headquarters, due to the high volume of devices which use the MP3 format; the format is the most popular method of storing digital music on portable music players, etc."}

West Ham were 10 points adrift of relegation safety at kickoff, and desperately needed points to secure a stay in the Premiership for next season. Tottenham on the other hand have been enjoying a good run of play as of late, and had a chance to jump above Portsmouth into 8th position in the Premiership.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nWest Ham started strongly in the match, desperately trying to bring the game to Tottenham with the support of their home fans urging them on. West Ham's first effort came in the second minute, but keeper Paul Robinson was able to beat away the shot of Mark Noble. Things took a downturn for the Hammers several minutes later, when Matthew Upson was forced off the pitch after aggravating a calf injury, and was replaced by Calum Davenport. Dimitar Berbatov then had two great chances for Tottenham, as he went one on one with keeper Robert Green, but Green was able to stop the Bulgarians attempts both times. West Ham continued to press, and were rewarded with a goal on 16 minutes. Paul Konchesky's pass was chested down by Argentinian Carlos Tevez, and Mark Noble half-volleyed the ball into the back of the net. Tottenham nearly got an equilizer only minutes later after a defensive error by West Ham, but Berbatov's shot was again saved by Green. More chances came for both sides in the forms of Defoe for Tottenham and Harewood for West Ham, but the next goal would come through the young Carlos Tevez. Michael Dawson fouled the Argintinian on the outside of the 18 yard box, and Tevez curved the ensuing free kick in under the crossbar. The goal was Teves' first since joining West Ham at the beginning of the season. He was booked for his goal celebration as he ripped off his shirt and ran into a group of cheering fans.&lt;br&gt;\nTottenham made a change to start the second half, substituting Tom Huddlestone for Hossam Ghaly, and Huddlestones prescence helped Tottenham to control the midfield. They used their control to its potential, and Aaron Lennon was able to earn a penalty after being brought down by Lee Bowyer in the area. Jermain Defoe stepped up and slotted the ball past Green to cut the Hammers lead in half. Spurs continued to press for an equilizer, and got it in the 63 minute as Lennon flicked a Berbatov cross into the path of Tainio, and the Finnish international volleyed the ball past Green. The tying goal seemed to wake West Ham up, and Bobby Zamora and Keppa Blanco were added to the mix to try and save the 3 points for the home side. West Ham got their goal, and Tevez was involved again as his cross was headed home by substitute Zamora. As 90 minutes approached, Tottenham won a free kick on the edge of the box, and Dimitar Berbatov stepped up to the plate. Several of Berbatov's attempts had been blocked by keeper Green already, but he would not be denied this time as he curled the ball into the top left corner, leaving the goalie helpless. Tevez again threatened Tottenhams goal, but his shot flew just wide. West Ham would be left to rue their missed chances when Defoe's shot was parried by Green, but the ball was tapped in by Canadian Paul Stalteri, giving the visitors their first lead of the game, and soon earning them all 3 points. The goal came just over 5 minutes into stoppage time, and there was no chance left for West Ham to equilize.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nWest Ham will continue their battle to stay in the Premiership in two weeks time against Blackburn, while Tottenham is due for an UEFA cup battle against Braga."}

Its round shape symbolizes wealth and good fortune and is believed to bring good luck.\nStarted in 1990, the Taipei lantern festival continues a 2000 year old tradition of light related festivals marking the end of the Chinese New Year celebrations. This particular event grows in popularity every year. Last Year over 4 million visitors attended the event and this year the city expects about 6 million visitors according to the event website.\nColorful lantern scenes not only fill the central square but also the surrounding 2 km circumference of the memorial. Each section has a theme. One side of the memorial is scenes made by student groups while other areas represent the counties of Taiwan. There is even a section of lanterns sponsored by foreign countries. The Malaysia Tourism board was quite prominent at the main entrance to the grounds. \nAs with all new year celebrations in Taiwan, the lantern festival is crowded. People flock to see the lantern scenes and enjoy the festival atmosphere as they carry lanterns, given away by the city and bought from street vendors at the event. The many light toys such a swords, devil ears, and lanterns turn the milling crowd into a unique light show that can be observed by climbing the steps of the 70 meter memorial hall on the grounds.\nLocal public transportation hubs are often swamped by the event. The station staff at Chiang Kai Shek Memorial Hall Station do an excellent job of crowd control but lines for the subway can still be hours long and very exhausting. A sudden rain storm on Sunday night (March 4)caused a mass exodus of people to head for the station prompting lines that backed up into the street. The commuting crowds can be avoided however by walking from NTU Hospital Station or Shandao Station. Both of these stops are only about a 20 minute walk from the event and have no crowds at all. \nIf you really want to avoid the crowds, definitely avoid the weekends. Wait until the fourth or fifth day of the festival when the crowds will have dwindled. I visited the festival on Saturday night, the opening night, and there was a sea of people in the square. I went back the next Tuesday night and there was almost no one there, just a few stray photographers taking advantage of the unimpeded views of the lanterns. The festival runs through March 11 this year."}

Funds raised in the match will go to support the Manchester United Foundation, which works with local charities as well as UNICEF to aid children in need. Italian Marcello Lippi will be in charge of coaching the European XI side, and his assistant will be Andy Roxburgh. Confirmed players have slowly been filing into the team, but with current Manchester United on-loan striker Henrik Larsson confirmed, the XI is now complete.\nPlayers.\nHenrik Larsson: &lt;br&gt;Current Club: Manchester United (loan)&lt;br&gt;Age: 35&lt;br&gt;Currently on loan to Manchester United from Helsingborg, Larsson has been in sharp form as of late. This charity match will act as a farewell for the Swede, as he is due back in Sweeden to play for his home club after his loan contract expires on March the 12th.\nDavid Beckham: &lt;br&gt;Current Club: Real Madrid&lt;br&gt;Age: 31&lt;br&gt;The former Manchester star will be returning to Old Trafford to play against his former club.

Nearly a thousand people were evacuated from the San Antonio neighborhood after the collapse. \nWikinews interviewed Eric Haddox, a civil engineer who has visited the site of the sinkhole and spoken to the engineers working on fixing the drain. Mr. Haddox, who specialises in the building of earthworks, roads, water supply and sewage systems, and is working as a missionary in Guatemala, visited the site following the collapse to help in the recovery effort.\nMr. Haddox told us that the size of the hole is much smaller than the 330 feet depth originally reported and that the erosion causing the collapse is believed to have happened over a long time, and not just during the recent rains as initially suspected. \nThere are also concerns that a four-story building less than a metre from the edge of the hole may collapse as the earth under the building continues to be eroded. \nTrouble brewing over years.\nBefore the collapse, a junction box linked two collector pipes to a 3.5m main pipe leading to a nearby canyon in a system believed to be 20 to 50 years old. The surrounding earth had been filled in artificially to level the ground, but the fill was not well compacted before being built upon. Such leveling of the ground is widespread in Guatemala city. \nIt is thought that, at some point in the last 20 years, either one of the collector pipes ruptured or was detached from the junction box, possibly because of seismic activity. Water gushing out of the break following rainstorms gradually eroded the loosely compacted soil, creating an expanding cavern around the junction box. On February 23, the roof of this cavern collapsed, creating the sinkhole, 20m wide at the top and tapering out towards the bottom, which is about 60m (204 feet) deep, not 330 feet as originally reported. \n\"Things like this don't happen often and there are many interesting engineering lessons to be learned with them\", Mr. Haddox said.\nThe sinkhole has continued to expand even after the collapse, since the collector pipes continue to carry water, which cascades 15m down the sinkhole to the main pipe, further eroding the sides of the sinkhole. The hole was about 25m wide at the top and 40m wide at the bottom a week ago. \nA bypass pipe is being laid to divert the water away from the junction to arrest further erosion. The sinkhole will then have to be drained before repair work can begin. \nAuthorities are also concerned that similar breakages and undermining may be happening at other locations, Mr. Haddox said. Muddy water has been seen coming out of the main collector pipes, but it is not certain whether this is due to ruptures elsewhere or simply mud from the surface that has been washed into the drainage system."}

Barcelona was up against the wall from the get-go after losing 2-1 in the first leg of the series. Due to the away goals rule (in the event of a tie after both games, the side to score more away goals advances), Barcelona required at at least two goals to advance. Liverpool have been strong at home this season, losing only one domestic league match this season at Anfield to rivals Manchester United. Liverpool featured one of their recent January signings in the match by the way of Alvaro Arbeloa, while Barcelona played their usual lineup including Ronaldinho and Deco.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThough Barca was the desperate team in the match, Liverpool were the more dominant side after the kickoff, as they used the support of their home crowd to boost them. After only 5 minutes, Steve Finnan crossed in a well placed ball to Bellamy, but the Welshman wasn't able to head the ball into the open net. Riise, who scored the winning goal in the first leg, continued to threaten Barcelona with two of his trademark long-range shots. The first flew just wide, and the second was even closer as it hit off the crossbar. Another attack by Liverpool made Barcelona look shaky as Victor Valdes was force into a double save, first off Bellamy, then off Dirk Kuyt. He could get nowhere near a diving header by Riise on the same play, but defender Puyol was able to clear the ball off the line to keep Barcelonas hopes alive. Liverpool would hit the bar again several minutes later, after a poor clearing attempt by Valdes was handed straight to Sissoko, and he was unfortunate to see his first time shot bang off the bar and go safely over the net. In the whole of the first half, Barcelona were not able to stretch Liverpools keeper Jose Reina, as the Reds defence snuffed out all of Barca's offensive talent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe second half started much as the first did, with Liverpool having a scoring chance within the minute. Captain Steven Gerrard made a run down the right side and crossed the ball into Kuyt, but the Dutchman missed the ball, and Bellamy wasn't expecting the ball to come to him as it flew safely through the area. Jose Reina was finally forced into a save on 50 minutes, but Ronaldinho's long range shot was easy pickings for the Spaniard. Ronaldinho would have another great chance minutes later as he made a quick run, exchange passes with Deco, and twisted past Jamie Carragher, only to see his side footed shot slam off the post. Barcelona continued to push, and a good save by Reina was required to keep youngster Lionel Messi from scoring. Barcelona's coach Frank Rikjarrd decided it was time for some changes and sent Giuly and Gudjohnsen into the mix. Gudjohnsen was used to playing against Liverpool after his years at Chelsea, and seemed to use it to his advantage as he received a pass from Xavi and slotted the ball home to give Barcelona sight of the next round. Ronaldinho then forced a save out of Reina, and Barcelona appeared to have regained their passing game, which caused the home fans to worry. Liverpool still played strongly, and Steven Gerrard was the main point of their inspiration winning a free kick, which was wasted, and then seeing a left footed effort palmed away by Victor Valdes. Liverpool had a chance to equalise in the final minutes, but were not able to convert. The one goal would not be enough for Barcelona however, as Liverpool advances to the next round of the Champions League."}

The first match ended 1-1 at the San Siro in Italy, and Inter needed a win or a draw of 2-2 or higher to advance.\nThe first half presented little in the way of goal chances for either team, with the biggest action in the form of a penalty appeal from Inter's Hernan Crespo. Crespo claimed to have been taken down by Robert Ayala, but referee Wolfgang Stark waved away the appeals. The only real attacks came in the form of long range shots, with Ibrahimovic taking one for Inter, and Sanchez attempting a blast for Valencia, but neither produced a goal. Valencias keeper Ca\u00f1izares then took exception to a foul by Zlatan Ibrahimovic, and both players were dealt bookings by the referee. Another penalty was appealed for by Inter, with Crespo again involved. Inter claimed the Argentine's shot was blocked off the arm of Valencia'a Raul Albiol, but again the referee waved play on. Valencia was forced into a change when Baraja was injured and replaced him with Hugo Viana.\nThe second half showed slightly more in the way of chances, and Valencia in particular upped the pace. Inter coped and had their own chance but a header from Dejan Stankovic was hit into the side netting. Inter again threatened, and could have taken the lead, but Marco Materazzi's header was cleared off the line by Marchena. Inter pushed now, but Valencia looked the more likely to score in the closing minutes with Marchena and Joaquin both coming close. It didn't matter however, as Valencia won the series on away goals.\nThe game erupted in violence and several players took swings at each other. The display was truly disgraceful after the incidents in Italy, and UEFA is sure to envoke punishment once everything has calmed down."}

The previous leg in the series saw the two teams draw 0-0 which gave Roma a slight advantage from the start, as a draw would allow them to advance. The previous match was extremely undisciplined, and Roma was given eight yellow cards. The Italian side showed a much calmer demeanor this game, earning only two yellows in comparison to Lyon's four.\nLyon produced the first chance of the game as Romas keeper Alexandre Doni was unable to cope with Juninho, but defender Philippe Mexes was able to clear the ball from nearby strikers. Roma had their own chance soon after, as Daniele De Rossi was left open, and he headed the ball home. The goal was disallowed by the referee after he spotted a push by De Rossi on Eric Abidal. Juninho continued to threaten Roma, but his crosses were not able to do any damage to the Rossinari. Lyon fell behind on 22 minutes when Max Tonetto clipped a cross into the middle, and Francesco Totti was in the right place to head the ball past Gregory Coupet. Crosses continued to be the only attack Lyon could muster, and they produced a good chance off a Juninho corner kick. The ball ricoched off several players before Squillaci latch on for a shot, but the ball was sent directly at Doni, and the keeper made the save. Mancini then doubled the visitors lead just before halftime. After some quick stepovers to fool Anthony Reveillere, he struck the ball soundly into the top corner of the net.\nAfter the break, Roma could have killed off the game indefinitely, as Tadei beat Lyon's offside trap, but was unable to regain the composure required to smash the ball home. Doni then produced a few saves for Roma, kicking out Sylvan Wiltord's shot, and then diving to palm away a curling shot by Juninho. Both teams then made vain attempts for a penalty, but both Fred and Perrotta diving, but the referee made the right decisions and awarded only a yellow to Perrotta. Fred was then given a yellow for cruelly smashing Chivu in the face with his arm. Fred was lucky to receive a red for his actions. Roma held on for the win, and the 5 time french champions bowed out of the Champions League."}

After the controversial winning goal from the first leg, United had a strong advantage in the series, and Lille needed a win to advance. The scorer of that controversial goal, Ryan Giggs, was left out of the lineup, and instead the more defensive minded John O'Shea was played. Lille started the game with a defensive lineup as well, hoping to stall the Red Devils, and make a score later in the match. Manchester United came into the game short of several key players due to injury, including Louis Saha (hamstring), Ole Gunnar Solsjkaer (surgery recovery), and Darren Fletcher (ankle). Striker Alan Smith was on the bench for United hoping to get back to first team action after a broken leg kept him out of the main squad for nearly a year.\nUnited grabbed the first of the chances 15 minutes into the game after Scholes popped in a cross to Rooney, but the young striker couldn't get his volley away in time, and Mathieu Chalme moved well to block. The ensuing corner saw another good chance present itself for United, but John O'Shea's powerful headed from Carrick's kick hit only the crossbar. Lille then had a chance of their own as Makoun strafed in behind the defence to connect with a freekick by Obraniak. Makoun's header was poor, and keeper Edwin Van Der Sar had and easy time collecting the ball. When Macnhester United earned themselves a freekick outside the Lille area, two Lille players placed themselves directly in front of Paul Scholes, not allowing him to take an early kick. Lille was appearing to be playing stronger, and made quick moves on the counter attack to worry United. One fine pass by Chalme into the box was aimed for a wide open Odemwingie, but he was not able to cleanly hit the ball, and the danger passed. Cristiano Ronaldo made his presence felt in the Lille area and was brought down by Chalme in the box. Instead of a penalty, Ronaldo was awarded a yellow card for what referee Luis Cantalejo considered a dive.\nThe second half saw Lille continue to dominate the football match, and the first threat came through a long range shot by Keita, but Van Der Sar saved well. Odemwingie was again on the attack, but was unfortunate to see his header smash off the post. United finally had a chance of their own in the second half when defender Nemanja Vidic connected with a free kick by Rooney, but the Serbian's header flew just over the goal. A sense of anxiety was starting to fill Old Trafford until Ronaldo and Larsson combined to put the series away after 72 minutes. Ronaldo used some of his trademark moves to outwit 3 Lille defenders and knocked a well aimed ball into Larsson, who forced a powerful header into the back of the net. The goal will be the last Larsson will score for United at Old Trafford, as his loan contract expires on the 12th of March. Larsson was applauded as he left the pitch and was replaced by Alan Smith, who was eager to impress after his extended absence from the team. Lille made two changes of their own, throwing Fauvergue and Mirallis into the fray, but they never looked likely to get the two goals they needed to advance. United went on to win, but now have even more injury worries as Mikael Silvestre had to be stretchered off the field after sustaining a head injury."}

PSV played an attacking side, with Arouna Kone and Jefferson Farfan in the front.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nPSV started strong out of the gate, and appeared to catch the home team by surprise with their determination. Arsenal were able to stave off the first attacks, and soon had the game under controlled and switched it into one way traffic. Fabregas and Denilson played strongly in the midfield to dictate the play for Arsenal, and soon chances began to show for the Gunners. The first fell to the Ivorian Kolo Toure, who pushed off his fellow countryman Kone, only to see his shot fly harmlessly wide of the net. More chances poured in for Arsenal, but the youngsters did not have the killer touch to finish off any clean shots on the goal. William Gallas of Arsenal had to leave the pitch to replace a contact lens, and PSV took a chance on the man advantage to press forward. Phillip Cocu put himself in a great position behind the defense, but spurned his chance as he headed the ball wide. Arsenal again pressed, as a header by Adebayor went wide, along with two volleys by Julio Baptista.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nAt the start of the second half, Arsenal continued to be frustrated by a combination of poor finishing and good defending by PSV. The Gunners would finally get the goal they needed after 58 minutes, thanks to an own goal by Alex. A corner by Arsenal allowed Adebayor to flick the ball on, and fortuitously it bounced off the hapless defender Alex and into the net. The goal boosted Arsenals confidence, and they continued to press the game. Arsenal nearly doubled their lead when Adebayor was sent one on one with keeper Heurelho, but his shot was directly at the keeper, and the game remained at 1-0 for the home side. As they pushed forward, Arsenal left gaps at the back, and Jefferson Farfan exposed one such gap before Denilson brought him down in the area, but no penalty was given. Henry then joined the fray from the bench, and though he didn't look completely comfortble, still managed to force Heurelho into a save with a dipping free kick. PSV would make Arsenal pay for their missed chances however, as Alex made up for his own goal and headed and Edison Mendez free kick home, tying the game and giving PSV the lead on aggregate. The aggregate loss concluded a sorrowful series of cup events for Arsenal after they lost in both the FA Cup and the Carling Cup, and now added the Champions League to the list."}

Bayern played a strong side, with Lucas Podolski and Roy Makaay in attack, and Owen Hargreaves in the midfield.\nAny plans Real had made for the game went immediately out the window when Roy Makaay scored the fastest ever goal in a Champions League match after only 10 seconds. Real took the kickoff, and Roberto Carlos was immediately dispossessed by Salihamidzic, who passed in the ball to Makaay. The German striker neatly finished passed Iker Casillas to stun the Galacticos, and give the home side the lead. Bayern continued to press, and Real looked listless, as shots from Podolski and Makaay were saved by Casillas. Real coach Fabio Capello was quick to make changes in his team, and sent on Guti in place of Emerson. Casillas was again forced into action as van Buyten headed Sagnol's free kick towards the goal, but the keeper got down well to make the stop. Madrid finally began to play like a team, and substitute Guti had a chance after a neat backheel by Higuain found him, but the shot flew wide. Real continued pressing, and Dutchman Ruud van Nistelrooy headed a ball towards the net, but Oliver Kahn was easily able to cope with the low power effort. Ra\u00fal then struck an acrobatic effort towards the goal, but found only the side netting.\nAfter the restart, Real looked shaky at the back again as van Bommel found his way in on goal, but Casillas was again on hand to snuff out the danger. Oliver Kahn was then forced into action at the other end, as he pushed out a van Nistelrooy header off of a cross by Ra\u00fal. Bayern had a penalty claim, but were denied by referee Lubos Michel. It didn't matter however, and the resulting corner was met by Lucio's head, doubling Bayerns lead. Bayern had another chance minutes later, but a open header by Salihamidzic went wide. Ra\u00fal then had a chance for Real, but his header was directed straight to Kahn. Ruud van Nistelrooy was then denied a run on goal after a mistaken offside call was given by the linesman. On 80 minutes, Robinho was hauled down by van Bommel in the penalty area, and Real was awarded a penalty. Marco van Bommel was consequently given his second yellow of the match for arguing the point, and was sent off along with Diarra of Real for his part in the confrontation. Once everything settled, van Nistelrooy stepped up to the spot and sent the ball into the net, cutting the lead in half, but still leaving Real behind on aggregate. The game finished dramatically, as Ramos thought he had scored to tie the game, but the referee correctly judged that a hand had been used in the build up, and the goal was not counted. The game ended in a win for Bayern, and they will go on to the next round, while Real is left to focus on domestic play."}

Then a few months later you notice in your photos from the trip that you camped inside a giant impact crater so big that no one documented it before. Could it happen?\nDuring several trips to the Black Rock Desert, mostly while supporting the Stratofox Aerospace Tracking Team for suborbital space rocket launch efforts, Ian Kluft KO6YQ noticed some oddities in rock formations. He had a little experience with volcanoes, and some rocks in the area looked unusual. There seemed to be some lava here and there - but where was the volcano? He observed that even a large caldera should have mostly volcanic rocks. He then noticed some curved geographic structures in satellite imagery which made him curious if it might be an impact crater.\nA TV documentary about meteor impacts mentioned some characteristics of impact craters. He went to the Internet to learn more. He noticed some of his own pictures of the area had cone shaped structures which might be \"shatter cones\" due to an impact shock wave that passed through the rocks. Discussion with others produced suggestions and volunteers who joined the effort. More circular features in satellite photographs were found. Igneous dikes through white layers of rock had been described and were visible in many photos.\nThe possible impact crater is 30 miles (48 km) wide east-to-west and 40 miles (64 km) north-to-south centered around 40.984045 N, 118.916016 W. That is in northwestern Nevada halfway between Reno and the Oregon border. The apparent ancient geological structure is so old that much of it is eroded away. The forces that eroded the Black Rock Desert itself, whether glacier or stream, have apparently cut through the crater rims and floor to do it.\nFollowing an expedition to the area in late January, more possible shatter cones were observed in one of the rock samples collected. These are only formed by the shock wave of an impact event or nuclear explosion. The nearest nuclear test was underground at Sand Springs Range in central Nevada. Atmospheric tests at the Nevada Test Site were at the southern, and opposite, end of the state. So that points toward an impact if confirmed. But professional geologists will want to have the final word on confirming them.\nIn addition to shatter cones, rock samples were thought to contain shocked quartz because the criss-cross fractures looked like examples in online documents. But this group of volunteers doesn't have equipment for proper photography of shocked quartz. If found, that would be another way to prove the impact origin of the rocks.\nColumnar jointed columns hundreds of feet tall appear on some bluffs in locations that appeared consistent with part of a slowly cooling crater floor. But that alone only helps as part of a bigger picture, because volcanoes can have lava cool in columnar joints as well.\nThey also found local geological studies which described oddities which could be explained by an impact event. Layers of rocks in the mining district called Sulphur left geologists with a mystery about the cause of chemical alterations since 1980. The group compared it with information in online geological texts like \"Traces of Catastrophe\" by Dr Bevan M French of the Smithsonian Institution. Layers of impact ejecta seemed to explain the rock layers better than the previous theory about acid uniformly cooking the rocks across the region, and only in one layer of rocks. A separate 1980 study 40 miles away identified an immense air-fall tuff layer in the Soldier Meadows area as having been deposited in a single unit, yet couldn't locate the volcano which produced this enormous volume. Fault diagrams published online by a mining operation at Sulphur on the edge of the circular structure from the satellite photo also look like curved terraced faults in the wall of a crater.\nThe mining geologists who wrote papers from 1980 to 2002 had not mentioned the possibility of a crater. But they were each gathering single puzzling pieces of information. A larger image seemed to be forming when putting the pieces together. The group hopes the information will be helpful to geologists who do further work in the region.\nThe theory hasn't been put to any test by professionals yet. Some responses point out that the elliptical region reported as the possible impact crater could also be the volcanic caldera that the 1980 study was looking for. If so, such a large volcanic caldera would still be a significant discovery for the region.\nThis will remain officially a mystery for a while until the professional geologists get to study it. There is a lot of information available online for those who are interested."}

With all first preference votes counted, both the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn F\u00e9in have made gains: the DUP received 30.1% of first preferences, an increase of 4.4 percentage points on the 2003 election, while Sinn F\u00e9in won 26.2%, up 2.6 percentage points. This means that the two parties have gained more than half of the vote. The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) came third with 15.2%, the Ulster Unionist Party fourth with 14.9% and the Alliance Party fifth with 5.2%.\nThe election is a crucial step in restoring devolved government to Northern Ireland, which has been under direct rule from Westminster since October 2002, when the Assembly was suspended after allegations that an IRA spy ring was operating there. The resulting court case collapsed. Attempts to get the leading unionist and nationalist parties to resume power-sharing had failed until the St Andrews Agreement was reached in October 2006. This agreement commits Sinn F\u00e9in to accepting the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the DUP to accepting power-sharing.\nAll 108 seats have now been filled. The DUP are the largest party with 36 seats, followed by Sinn F\u00e9in with 28 seats. Their combined total of 64 seats gives the two parties a majority of ten in the Assembly, assuming that they are willing to work together. Among others, DUP leader Ian Paisley has been elected in North Antrim, as has Sinn F\u00e9in leader Gerry Adams in West Belfast. DUP deputy leader Peter Robinson topped the poll in East Belfast, where Naomi Long of the Alliance Party was also elected. The leaders of the other two main parties were also elected: Mark Durkan of the SDLP was elected on the first count in Foyle, while Ulster Unionist leader Sir Reg Empey was elected on the third count in East Belfast. Alliance Party leader David Ford was elected in his constituency of South Antrim on the fifth count. Dawn Purvis, leader of the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP), was elected on the last count in East Belfast. The Green Party won their first ever seat in the Northern Ireland Assembly, when their Northern Ireland chairperson Brian Wilson was elected on the tenth count in North Down with 2839 first preference votes.\nAnna Lo of the Alliance Party has become the first candidate from an ethnic minority background to have been elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly, winning a seat in South Belfast with the fourth highest first preference vote in the constituency, 3829 votes. She said her decision to stand had been an extension of her community work, and that she wanted to give a voice to Chinese people who never felt they had any part to play in Northern Ireland politics. She also said she hoped that indigenous voters who were fed up with \"tribal politics\" would give her their support, and that she was determined \"to be much more than a candidate for ethnic minorities\". \nCounting the votes cast in the 600 polling stations continued through to Friday 9 March. Turnout was 63.5%, down 0.5 percentage points on the previous election. Assembly elections use the Single Transferable Vote (STV) method of proportional representation, with each constituency returning six MLAs.\nA new power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive is to be formed by 26 March, according to the St Andrews Agreement. The election of a First Minister and Deputy First Minister requires the support of a majority of unionist MLAs and of nationalist MLAs (\"parallel consent\"). In practice this means that the largest unionist party and the largest nationalist party must agree to share power. If they cannot agree by the deadline the Northern Ireland Assembly at Stormont will be suspended again and MLAs will have their salaries and allowances stopped. Though there has been criticism of the deal reached at St Andrews by elements within both the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in, the government in Westminster believes that these dissenters are in a minority.\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Peter Hain said to CNN: \"I'm optimistic that we can achieve a working government on March 26, but it's a very stark choice for them \u2014 get into power, or shut up shop\". But he also warned that \"if this falls over on March 26, there is no prospect of another settlement for a very long time, maybe years\". On Friday 9 March Mr Hain began separate meetings with the leaders and deputy leaders of the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in.\nSinn F\u00e9in leader Gerry Adams said he had \"no problem\" with working with the Unionists and shaking the hand of Ian Paisley: \"I think it is very, very important in terms of representing a community that for a long time was marginalized and excluded. We're about reaching out to the Unionists\".\nBut Ian Paisley claimed that Sinn F\u00e9in's decision to support the police had been \"qualified\", and said, \"you can't pick and choose how far you are prepared to go for peace.\" He also said that Sinn F\u00e9in had to \"turn from their evil ways\". To the BBC he said: \"We will enter into talks tomorrow with the Secretary of State, we will be meeting the Prime Minister next week, and the hard negotiations are now going to start. Sinn F\u00e9in are not entitled to be at the table until they declare themselves for democracy. I am a democrat, I don't speak to loyalist paramilitaries, I don't speak to Sinn F\u00e9in\".\nOn Friday 9 March British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern made a joint statement. They said, \"The message of the electorate is clear. After so many years of frustration and disappointment, they want Northern Ireland to move on to build a better future together through the restored institutions. Many of the practical issues which have been raised in this election campaign can and should be resolved locally.\" They said that they would work closely with the Northern Irish parties to restore devolved government by the deadline of 26 March and praised the progress already made in this direction. \"The people of Northern Ireland have suffered grievous pain and loss. But enormous progress has been made and there is now no good reason why we should not be able to complete this historic process. All must now take responsibility in government for building and consolidating peace, this is what the people of Northern Ireland want. They deserve no less.\""}

Danny Koevermans scored late in the game to give AZ a crucial away goal, but the Dutch side will have to have a better defensive showing if they hope to advance in the second leg.\nMaccabi Haifi 0 - 0 Espanyol.\nEspanyol traveled to Israel to take on Maccabai Haifi at the Kiryat-Eli'ezer Stadium. The game ended in a draw, leaving Maccabi needing only a draw in the second leg to advance to the next round.\nRangers 1 - 1 Osasuna.\nThe Spanish team Osasuna visited Rangers at Ibrox Stadium. Osasuna scored first after 17 minutes, with Raul Garcia scoring the crucial away goal. Rangers let the game go very late before tying the match through Brahim Hemdani on 92 minutes. The tie gives Osasuna a slight advantage next game, as long as they can keep Rangers off the scoresheet.\nBraga 2 - 3 Tottenham Hotspur.\nIn a nervy game at the Estadio Municipal de Braga, Tottenham came away with a fantastic result, defeating Portuguese side Braga at their home field. All the scoring occurred in the second half, and Tottenham struck first through Robbie Keane. Steve Malbranque then doubled the lead for Spurs on 72 minutes. Braga fancied a comeback, and Paulo Jorge game them a lift on 76 minutes to cut the lead in half. Ze Carlos the tied the game for the home side after 81 minutes. All would be for naught for the homeside however, as Robbie Keane earned a brace in stoppage time to give the visitors the win.\nSevilla 2 - 2 Shakhtar Donetsk.\nTwo penalties kept this match tied, as Shaktar of the Ukraine visited current La Liga leaders Sevilla. Sevilla, who have been on a high as of late after beating Barcelona, struck first in this match with Jose Luis Marti getting the goal. Tomas Hubschman tied the game for Shaktar on 18 minutes, and the took the lead on 60 after a penalty was awarded to them by referee Viktor Kassai. The guests looked set for the win, but Sevilla earned their own penalty on 88 minutes, and Enzo Maresca converted the chance to tie the game.\nLens 2 - 1 Bayer Leverkusen.\nFrench side Lens defeated Bayer Leverkusen of Germany at the Stade Felix-Bollaert in France. The home side scored first and Olivier Monterrubio got the goal on 17 minutes. Karim Haqui responded for the Germans after the break to tie the game at one. Lens were then awarded a penalty, and Daniel Cousin scored to give Lens the win.\nParis Saint Germain 2 - 1 Benfica.\nThe visitors scored first in the match at the Parc des Princes in France, but PSG were not deterred by the early goal by Simao Sabrosa. Simaos compatriot Pauleta tied the game for PSG on 36 minutes, and Pierre-Alain Frau gave the homeside the lead 5 minutes later. PSG hung on to give them the advantage in the second leg of the cup series.\nCelta Vigo 0 - 1 Werder Bremen.\nVisitors Bremen won the game thanks to an 84th minute goal by Hugo Almeida. The win gives the Bundesliga side a great chance at advancing to the quarterfinals, while Celta will have to play hard in the next leg and earn a win on the road if they hope to continue in the competition."}

He then later retracted that in an unsigned court statement, stating mental health problems. \"I did not murder Janelle Patton.\"\nHer body was found wrapped partially in plastic wrap at a picnic/nature reserve, with her underpants pulled down.\nHer underpants being pulled down was used in Mr McNeill's defence saying that the attack was done by a woman, and the underwear was to try and throw the police off the correct path.\nMr McNeill will be sentenced at a later date.\nAn appeal is being considered, with Mr McNeill's lawyer stating significant grounds."}

According to Adam Gartenberg from IBM Lotus Software Group this was the main cause for this partial stagnation.\nHowever, the UC2 is meant to ease the work of software developers. Gartenberg stated that this platform is very flexible and will certainly draw much attention form programmers. They will be able to create different plug-ins and small applications to remotely control other, major application. \nThe companies have also unveiled a series of their other joint projects. These project will be based on a set of application programming interface from Lotus (SameTime) and Cisco.\nThe add-ons planned are integration of a series of additional functions and features into the SameTime software from Lotus. Thus, in a few months, the SameTime users will benefit from such functions as click-to-call and voicemail. This will enable easier instant messaging inside the Cisco's Unified IP phones' system.\nThe fact that the platform will be based on Eclipse will make the numerous developers create many communications services, mainly for remote users to benefit from a series of new functions of ERP and CRM applications.\nNortel Networks - a partner of Microsoft since last year and Cisco's rival in the area - didn't have much success in the communication services field.\nAs for Microsoft, the experts are waiting for the reaction of the Bill Gates' company on the ideas and offers made by IBM and Cisco for enterprise communications and collaboration solutions."}

The governments of the 27 countries in Brussels endorsed 3 main binding targets:\nThis way, the E.U. wants to contribute in reaching the strategic goal of limiting the global average temperature increase to less than 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. The individual targets for countries will need to be established based on national starting points and potentials, according to the plan. The plans don't mention an enforcement mechanism yet.\nIn the summit's conclusions, the E.U. underlines its ambitions as a leading force in international climate protection. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the targets \"ambitious and credible\". \nEurope is prepared to even increase the objectives if other developed countries follow suit, and it invites other countries to come forward with their plans for the environment beyond 2012, when the Kyoto protocol ends. In June, Merkel plans to discuss the measures with the other members on the Group of Eight summit.\nThe proposal takes into account the sovereignty of individual countries to determine exactly which energy sources they use. More specifically, each member state should decide if they wish to use nuclear power or not. Some countries oppose the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels, and Germany is even in the process of dismantling its nuclear energy production. France on the other hand produces 70% of its electricity in nuclear power plants. [13% of France's total energy consumption is nuclear.] The report also stresses the importance of nuclear safety in the discussion over nuclear energy.\nThe summit also asked the European Commission to come up with proposals to reduce energy consumption in lighting and offices by 2008 and 2009. The idea is to replace conventional light bulbs with more energy-efficient alternatives such as the energy saving light bulb.\nAnother energy-related topic in the conclusions is an agreement on increased security of energy supply. Through member state solidarity and a more interconnected and integrated market, eastern European countries hope to secure their energy supplies in case Russia would cut the supply.\nDuring their two-days summit, the E.U. also discussed economic growth, employment, better regulations and international relations issues."}

It has been a constant reminder of the political situation of the Mediterranean island (given independence from Britain in 1960) that has suffered divisions since communal violence in 1963 that was only prevented by establishing a United Nations Peacekeeping Force there in 1964. These divisions only deepened when Cyprus was invaded by Turkey\u2019s military in mid-July 1974 after right-wing Greek Cypriots (backed by the military junta ruling Greece at the time) attempted a coup with the intent of joining the island to Greece. The result was a split between the internationally recognized Greek Cypriot government in the south and the Turkish Cypriot north (only recognized by Turkey). The division at Nicosia has become a curiosity to tourists who look over it to see the buffer zone between the two factions (a no man\u2019s land with abandoned homes and businesses where no civilians are allowed). The destruction of the wall also brought out curious Cypriots.\nMuch international pressure had been brought to bear on both sides, and thawing of the relationship between the opposing Cypriots began in 2003 when the Turkish side eased restrictions on travel. Still in 2004 before joining the E.U., Greek Cypriots rejected the UN reunification plan that called for a federation of two states. Then in December 2005 when the Turkish Cypriots created a footbridge for Turkey\u2019s soldiers on the other side, the action drew protests from the Greek Cypriots voicing their security concerns. In January 2007 the Turkish Cypriots began dismantling the footbridge as a gesture of good faith.\nAt first both Cypriot governments expressed hope of reunification when asked about the demolition. Tassos Papadopoulos, the president in the Greek south stated \"Tonight we have demolished the checkpoint on our side.\u201d He went on to call for the Turkish Cypriots to act, saying civilians will not be able to cross \u201cif the troops are not withdrawn\u201d. Rasit Pertev, chief adviser to Mehmet Ali Talat, the leader of Turkish Cyprus said: \"This is extremely symbolic... The dynamism created by this move will lead to the opening of the crossing.\" Still when the government of Turkey dismissed the move as merely a result of international pressure that did not signify anything, and refused to dismiss its troops in the area (it maintains 40,000 soldiers on the island), sheets of aluminum were put up as a barricade on the Greek Cypriot side early on the morning of March 9, 2007."}

Buffalo, New York in the United States may be a potential destination for some women in Ontario with high-risk pregnancies or premature babies.\nAccording to a Sunnybrook press release, the High Risk Perinatal Service will remain closed until there are no new transmissions of the \"Staphylococcus aureus\" bacterium. It further explains that outbreaks in the NICU are rare and that several measures have been put in place to keep the bacterium from spreading. The hospital has isolated babies who have symptoms and are ensuring that a specific team of clinicians only treat the affected babies.\nThe Sunnybrook press release suggests that, although MRSA bacteria are commonly found on the skin of newborns, the organism that has surfaced in the NICU has caused a variety of infections to the skin and eyes of the babies.

United, who have their eye on three trophies this year, were forced to scramble back for the draw against Middlesbrough, who have been forced into replays in all three previous rounds, with two going all the way to penalties. United were the strong favourites for the match, and sent Wayne Rooney and Henrik Larsson up front as strike partners, with Ronaldo supporting from midfield. 'Boro also fielded a strong attacking side, with Yakubu and Mark Viduka leading the way. United was forced into a keeper change before the match, as Edwin Van Der Sar had a calf injury and was replaced by Tomasz Kuszczak.\nMiddlesbrough had the first of the chances in the game through Stuart Dowing after he received a pass from Julio Arca and was able to run in alone at Kuszczak. The keeper positioned himself well however, and he deflected Downing's shot out for a corner. United soon was in control of the game, and their first chance came when Larsson passed in a ball to Rooney, but the young Englishmans shot flashed wide. Rooney would not miss on his next chance though, as he received a pass from Giggs and slotted the ball past Mark Schwarzer from outside the penalty area. Kuszczak was then called on again to keep United in the lead when Yakuba did well to turn defender Rio Ferdinand, and released a shot at the net, but Kuszczak dove to make the save. Manchester's skipper Gary Neville then provided Ryan Giggs with a long cross into the box, but the Welshman's one-time volley clipped off the opposite post and stayed out of the net. Middlesbrough made United pay for their missed chance before the break, and the 18 year old Lee Cattermole was the goal scorer. Kuszczak made an error of coming out to catch the ball, and he became mixed up with Ferdinand, who headed clear instead. The ball went to Arca however, and the Argentine headed the ball to Cattermole, who controlled, spun, and volleyed neatly past the sprawling Polish keeper, tying the match.\nMiddlesbrough would start the second half the same way they ended the first; with a goal. Cattermole earned a corner off Heinze, and Downing curled the free kick deep, where skipper George Boateng was waiting to head the ball easily past Kuszczak. The goal was the first for Boateng in all competitions this season. Being a goal down was a shock to United, who have rarely fallen behind after leading this season, and they soon were on the attack. Henrik Larsson had the first of the chances, but his shot was blocked by Parnaby. A flick on by Ferdinand after a Giggs corner hit Boateng's hand, and the hero soon became the villain as referee Rob Styles rewarded a penalty to Manchester United. Christiano Ronaldo stepped up, and after a studder step slotted the ball past Schwarzer's right side, even though the German keeper went the right way. The game was tied yet again, and both teams pushed for the win, neither wanting a replay. Middlesbrough looked the most likely to score for much of the rest of the match as Viduka made space for Parnaby to shoot, but the ball was aimed right at Kuszczak who collected easily. 'Boro then introduced Jason Euell and Lee Dong-gook into the match in an attempt for the win, but the game ended in stalemate instead.\nThe replay will take place March 19 between the two at Old Trafford, which doesn't give either club much rest after their March 17 Premiership games, when United take on Bolton at home, and 'Boro will host Manchester City at the Riverside. Manchester also will be playing their European charity match beforehand, which takes place on the 13th."}

The charges against Herman were that he arranged and facilitated travel for the purpose of illicit sexual conduct.\nOriginally Herman's website was investigated by Decensi for counterfeit goods labeled as \"replica\" merchandise, using such brand names as Rolex. Various guided tours of Thailand were also on offer at the website, either aimed at contacting the sources of counterfeit goods or \"marriage agencies where you can marry a beautiful young Thai girl between 18- 24 years old regardless of your age.\"\nFrom June to late October of 2006, posing under the screen name of \"david77\" and claiming to be from Ohio, Special Agent Decensi exchanged emails with Herman who was on his seventh trip to Thailand. Herman assured that he knew all the \"pick up\" spots where young girls could be found. When Decensi inquired about girls aged 10-14 years he was cautioned by Herman that it was dangerous and illegal in Thailand, explaining that the punishment in Thailand would be severe. However, Herman went on to explain that he knew where to find what Decensi was looking for, and gave a cell phone number to call upon his arrival in Bangkok.\nInstead of flying to Thailand, Agent Decensi passed the online persona of \"david77\" onto Assistant Attach\u00e9 Gary Kiernan in Bangkok who phoned Herman. After declining an offer to go to Cambodia the two arranged to meet in Udon Thani. Offering to take Kiernan to brothels where girls of 15 were kept having been illegally brought into the country from Laos. On a tour of a number of brothels Assistant Attach\u00e9 Kiernan saw girls with ages ranging from 12 to 17.\nTelling Herman that he must fly back to the U.S., Kiernan avoids anything more than his tour of brothels. Assuring Herman he will return when an urgent job has been done he establishes that Herman will return to the U.S. on December 12.\nInitially filed in Herman's home town of Las Vegas the case was transferred to Cleveland where Herman was detained. At present he remains in custody pending sentencing. The charge, Facilitating Travel to Engage in Illicit Sexual Content carries a sentence of up to 30 years. According to the Bangkok Post he is likely to receive a sentence between four and five years."}

The official announcement gives the candidate from the majority party UMP, Nicolas Sarkozy, more freedom during the next six weeks that remain before the Presidential elections in France. Although Sarkozy is from the same party as Chirac and hopes to receive an endorsement from him, the President has not yet expressed his support for a particular candidate to succeed him, and he did not refer to Sarkozy during any moment of his speech.\nIn his 4 decades in French politics, Chirac has occupied several posts as Minister and was Prime Minister twice before being elected President in 1995, and being re-elected in 2002. Shortly after taking office, he acknowledged the role of France in the deportation of 75,000 Jews during World War II. After he called for new elections in 1997, he had to work with a Socialist Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin for 5 years. In 2001, France became the first country to declare slavery a crime against humanity, and Chirac decided May 10 would be a day to commemorate the abolition of slavery.\nIn 2003, Chirac threatened to veto a resolution in the U.N. Security Council that would approve of an invasion of Iraq. Consequently, the United States overthrew Saddam Hussein without support from the United Nations. In 2005, Chirac couldn't convince the French to approve the European Constitution in a referendum. At the end of that year, minority youths in France's suburbs rioted for three weeks.\nDuring his address, the President also discussed the democratic values of France, his role and responsibilities, Europe and the environment.\nIn the polls, Sarkozy has a slight benefit over S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, the candidate from the Socialist Party. Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, the candidate from the centrist party UDF, has improved his positions in the polls during the last few weeks, coming up in third position by only a few points. If none of the candidates reach an absolute majority during the first round on April 22, a second round between the two candidates with the most votes will be organised. In the polls, at least 40% of voters have said they are yet undecided about their vote in the upcoming ballot."}

Tottenham seemed to have a spot in the semifinals of the FA Cup all wrapped up before two late strikes from Lampard and Kalou ruined the day for Spurs. Chelsea were again without the heart of their defence, John Terry, and it showed for much of the game as Tottenham broke through the Blues lines far too easily on several occasions. Chelsea came out to win though, and nearly all their main stars were on the pitch to start the match, including Shevchenko, Ballack, Drogba, and Lampard. Martin Jol's Tottenham also fielded a strong attacking side, even without the use of the injured Robbie Keane. Defoe, Berbatov, and Lennon lead the way for Spurs instead, with Canadian Paul Stalteri and Englishman Michael Dawson on defence. Tottenham also had to use their backup keeper Radek Cerny, as their number one Paul Robinson is with Keane on the injured list.\nTottenham came out fast and hard, scoring after only 5 minutes. Jermain Defoe cut in from the left and attempted a pass to Hossam Ghaly, but Aaron Lennon pick up the ball instead and sent it in to the Bulgarian striker Dimitar Berbatov. Chelsea keeper Petr Cech sprinted out in an attempt to block, but Berbatov spun and volleyed the ball high into the back of the net, giving the visitors the early lead. Tottenham pressed for a second, and two chances presented themselves to Defoe and Lennon, but the crossesfrom Berbatov and Defoe were out of the players reaches. Chelsea would strike back though, and the goal would be against the run of play. Ballack received a chested down ball from Shevchenko after a Drogba cross, and the German blasted the ball low and hard. The shot was off target, but Frank Lampard was able to react quickly enough to fling out his leg and deflect the ball into the back of the net. Tottenham continued to run at the shaky Chelsea defence, and were rewarded with a goal when Aaron Lennons seemingly harmless cross was knock into Chelsea's net by Michael Essien, who was attempting to cover back on defence. Tottenham then nearly gave Chelsea an own goal of their own as Michael Dawson knocked Arjen Robbens cross toward his own net, but Paul Stalteri raced back to clear off the line. After the near tying goal, made an early change by replacing Paulo Ferreira with Shaun Wright-Phillips. Another defensive error would see Chelsea two behind soon after though, as Ghaly beat three defenders to a high ball, and slotted the ball past Cech from 12 yards out. Chelsea had a few more chances as they tried to grab a lifeline before the break, but nothing truly troubled keeper Cerny.\nChelsea came out of the dressing room much more positively after the break, and had 3 chances to score from 2 Ballack free kicks, and a well taken shot by Lampard. Cerny did well to keep the game at 3-1 however. Spurs nearly put the game away on the counter attack, but Cech came out quick to stop Aaron Lennons run, and Defoe could not find the net after the ensuing cross by Ghaly. Chelsea then made 2 changes in just over 5 minutes, as Boulahrouz and Kalou took to the pitch. On the 70th minute, Chelsea earned a corner, and Arjen Robben stepped up to take the set piece. A goulmouth scramble occurred from the curving corner and the ball landed nicely at Lampard's feet. The Enlgishman blasted it home, cutting the deficit to one. Chelsea equliazed 4 minutes from time through substitute Salomon Kalou. Didier Drogba headed the ball to his fellow countryman Kalou, and the Ivorian volleyed the ball into the back of the net. Jermain Defoe had a chance to be the hero for Tottenham only minutes later as he beat out three defenders and struck the ball hard past Cech, but not past the crossbar. The game ended drawn, and the replay will be held at White Hart Lane on March 19th."}

The suspension, for a minimum of 25 games, is a ruling for a hit Simon laid on Ryan Hollweg of the New York Rangers during a March 8 game at Nassau Veterans' Memorial Coliseum.\nIn a press release earlier today, the NHL indicated that they considered Simon's hit on Hollweg, with a stick to the face, to be a deliberate intent to injure. \"The National Hockey League will not accept the use of a stick in the manner and fashion in which Mr. Simon used his Thursday night,\" said Colin Campbell, NHL Senior Executive Vice President and Director of Hockey Operations.\nThe incident occurred at 13:29 of the third period. After receiving a hard check from Hollweg, Simon swung his stick and delivered a two-handed blow to Hollweg's upper body, causing a cut on Hollweg's chin. Simon was assessed a match penalty. \nBased on his $1-million contract, which expires at the conclusion of the 2006-07 season, Simon forfeits a minimum of $80,213.90. The money goes to the Players' Emergency Assistance Fund.\nThe suspension could carry over into the 2007-2008 hockey season, depending on how far the Islanders advance into the playoffs. According to the NHL press release, if the Islanders do not qualify for the 2007 playoffs, or play fewer than 10 playoff games in the 2007 playoffs, Simon would serve additional games at the start of the 2007-08 regular season to satisfy the minimum term of the suspension.\nGarth Snow, General Manager of the Islanders, indicated his support for Simon in a brief press release. \"I spoke with Colin Campbell this morning and he informed me of his decision. Chris Simon has played a major role in our success this season and we will miss his presence in our lineup. His regret is clearly evident in the statement he released last night. Our entire organization supports Chris every step of the way.\"\nIn a statement March 10, prior to the verdict, Simon expressed regret for his actions. \"After watching the tape the morning after Thursday's game, I was disgusted. There is absolutely no place in hockey for what I did. I want to apologize to Ryan Hollweg. I was grateful to learn that Ryan is okay and that he returned to the game. My hope is to reach out to him in the near future.\"\nSimon explains that his behavior may have been influenced by a hit he received less than a minute before his stick swinging incident. \"I do not remember much about Thursday's incident. When I saw the tape on Friday morning, it explained a lot to me when I saw the look on my face after being hit into the boards. I was completely out of it.\"\nSimon didn't appear to let it excuse his hit on Hollweg. \"I need to make clear that this is not justification for the danger I put Ryan Hollweg in and the damage I have caused the game. I understand disciplinary action will be taken.\"\nThe Associated Press indicated that criminal charges against Simon are being considered. According to a spokesperson for Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice, \"no decision has been reached\" on bringing charges, but that \"prosecutors would review the tape.\""}

The vote on Sunday was the latest in a series of attempts to cut rising costs and ease the financial burden on citizens.\nAround 71% of voters rejected the reform. Turnout was at about 46%, slightly above the Swiss average.\nAs expected, voters in the main German-speaking part of the country turned down the planned reform, which was supported by the centre-left but opposed by the centre-right as well as the business community, parliament and the government.\nOpposition in the French and Italian speaking regions was less pronounced. The cantons Jura and Neuch\u00e2tel in the French speaking regions voted in favor of the proposed reforms.\nHealth insurance premiums are higher in southern and western Swiss cantons than in German-speaking areas.\nThe Swiss Interior Minister Pascal Couchepin said an important part of the Swiss Population appeared to be opposed to \"a revolution\" in health insurance but he said that he wanted current reforms currently under discussion in the Swiss Parliament to go ahead. He called on all sides, especially health insurers and the cantonal authorities, to make efforts to reduce spending on health insurance and aim for a greater cost efficiency. Currently Switzerland has 87 private insurers providing mandatory basic health care coverage for Swiss residents under a 1996 law. But costs have sky-rocketed. Over 100,000 people are not covered by health insurance due to non payment.\nOpponents to the initiative argued that a single insurance system would lead to complacency and create a two-tier system, in which the wealthy would be the only ones available to afford to have additional private insurance coverage.\nSupporters of the initiative said a single health insurer would increase the system's efficiency and allow for annual savings of at least 300 million Swiss Francs (about $245 million) in administrative costs. Currently, the funding system is unbalanced, since many clients on low incomes use state subsidies to pay their premiums, according to the Green Party and the Social Democrats.\nThe initiative to unite all the insurance companies and introduce premiums based on wealth and income was the most recent in a series of attempts over the past ten years to reduce the public spending on health care. A proposal, similar to this recent proposal, to modify the funding system of the health insurance companies was rejected by 73% of voters in 2003.\nSwitzerland has the most expensive health system in Europe. Switzerland's expenditure on health care was 11.6% in 2005, in front of Germany and France but behind the United States."}

The report also says the government is allowing militias such as the Janjaweed to act with impunity, and that government forces are even operating jointly with the militia. The militias themselves and the armed rebel groups aren't spared either; they are accused of serious violations of human rights and international law.\nDuring their month of work, the researchers didn't actually get into Sudan because they were not given visas, but they interviewed hundreds of relevant people (such as refugees), and reviewed thousands of pages from documents on the humanitarian situation in Darfur.\nTo summarise the situation, the 35-page documents says: \"Today, millions are displaced, at least 200,000 are dead, and conflict and abuse are spilling over the border into Chad.\" The report says that humanitarian and human rights workers are increasingly being targeted, especially during the past six months. \"Killing of civilians remains widespread, ... Rape and sexual violence are widespread and systematic. Torture continues.\" The experts think the conflict could destabilise the region.\nThe mission advises the U.N. General Assembly to \"request the compilation of a list of foreign companies that have an adverse impact on the situation of human rights in Darfur.\" The U.N. agencies should then cease to do business with these companies.\nSudanese officials declined to respond to the report immediately, saying that the response will be made in Sudan's address to the United Nations Human Rights Council on Tuesday. Just days ago, Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir rejected an interim U.N. plan to bolster African Union peacekeeping forces in Darfur. Up to 24,000 troops were to replace the current 7,000 African Union peacekeepers in the western Sudan region.\nThe almost 4-year-old Darfur conflict is being fought between the Janjaweed militia (Arabic for \"devils on horseback\"; they are camel-herding Arabs) and a group of mostly land-tilling tribes. The Sudanese government in the past denied allegations against them, blaming the rebels who didn't sign the peace treaty of 2006. The International Criminal Court in The Hague has already summoned a junior minister of the Sudan, and a militia leader, to answer war crime charges. The government in Khartoum refused to extradite anyone, saying the people responsible would be tried in the Sudan itself."}

The three major US stock market indices each fell two percent from Monday's closing price, marking the second-biggest loss of 2007. London's FTSE 100, Paris' CAC 40 and Frankfurt's DAX 30 indices each closed down more than 1 percent.\nAs the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that late payments on mortgages and home foreclosures in the US homes rose in the fourth quarter to their highest level in years, investors are concerned that not only US banks but also multi-national banks around the globe could have exposure.\nMore than two dozen sub-prime lenders have closed or sold operations as defaults on those mortgages have risen. \"The delinquencies and defaults have started to soar,\" said Nicolas Retsinas, director of Housing Studies at Harvard University. \"A lot of these lenders started to make loans and lost track of some of the fundamentals.\" \nNew Century Financial Corporation, the second largest sub-prime lender in the US, has recently revealed that its creditors were no longer providing funds and, further, it has become subject of an SEC investigation. The New York Stock Exchange has said it will delist New Century. Accredited Home Loan Lending, another major sub-prime mortgage specialist, said it was seeking fresh capital and waivers on its lending covenants.\nSub-prime lenders provide mortgages to people who do not qualify for loans from mainstream lenders, typically due to their credit histories. The lenders then bundle these mortgages as collateral for loans that they obtain from other financing firms, such as GMAC. Such firms can then repackage these loans and sell them as mortgage-backed securities. These securities may end up in the hands of major multi-national banks such as Citibank, HSBC, and Commerzbank. Each level of lending assumes a level of financial risk, but trouble can arise when the risk tolerances are exceeded. If too many homeowners default on their mortgages, the sub-prime lender can end up defaulting. If too many of these lenders default, as it is feared may be happening now, the defaults can cascade upward. While no one is predicting major bank failures at this point, it is feared that their profits could be hurt."}

And while no one is claiming that we have found life by any means, we probably have evidence for a place that might be hospitable to life,\" said Dennis Matson, a scientist for the Cassini project.\nIn a new model created by NASA scientists, data shows that Enceladus might have been created by aluminum and iron isotopes which have begun to decay causing large amounts of heat to build up in the moon and over billions of years later, the icy mass has began to melt near the moon's core, causing the water to spew into outer space.\n\"Enceladus is a very small body, and it's made almost entirely of ice and rock. The puzzle is how the moon developed a warm core. The only way to achieve such high temperatures at Enceladus is through the very rapid decay of some radioactive species,\" said Dr. Julie Castillo, the lead scientist developing the new model at the Jet Propulsion laboratory or JPL.\n\"The decomposition of those isotopes - over a period of about 7 million years - would produce enormous amounts of heat. This would result in the consolidation of rocky material at the core surrounded by a shell of ice. According to the theory, the remaining, more slowly decaying radioactivity in the core could continue to warm and melt the moon's interior for billions of years, along with tidal forces from Saturn's gravitational tug,\" said a statement on NASA\"s website.\nData from Cassini's ion and neutral mass spectrometer further shows that the natural building blocks of life are also present within Enceladus. The results show that carbon dioxide, acetylene, methane, propane and nitrogen, the basic building blocks for life, are all present within the moon.\n\"The team concludes that so far, all the findings and the hot start model indicate that a warm, organic-rich mixture was produced below the surface of Enceladus and might still be present today, making the moon a promising kitchen for the cooking of primordial soup,\" added the statement.\nCassini will make a flyby on Enceladus in march of 2008. The mission will \"measure the gas emanating from the plume,\" ended the statement."}

The new study shows that these risks include higher risk of childhood sexual abuse. This especially concerns low-income one-parent households.\nDr. William C. Holmes, MD, MSCE, Assistant Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology at the University of Pennsylvania says that the problem involves psychological and emotional aspects. \n\u0421hildren from one-parent homes do need more communication with their moms or dads. However, the parents are often absent from the home, being busy working to provide their children with basic necessities. The children have to find someone who would be a parent-substitute with whom to communicate and to share experiences. Molesters take advantage of this situation and become friends to these emotionally-needy children. \nHolmes says that low-income single-parent households are at greater risk due to the type of childcare facilities available to children from such families. Unfortunately, these are not facilities with thorough oversight of who is a caregiver of a child.\nAccording to Holmes, studies like this one suggest that there should be some interventions to help single parents and their children, for instance through funding of better childcare facilities.\nSource.\n "}

Mr Tsvangirai told the BBC that police beat him repeatedly in the head, back, knees and arm and that he lost two pints (one litre) of blood in an attack that seemed intended \"to inflict as much harm as they could.\" William Bango, Mr Tsvangirai's spokesman, said: \"He has just had a brain scan because his skull is cracked. He will be here for some time. He is in the intensive care unit.\" A doctor treating Mr Tsvangirai said his condition was stable and he could be released from hospital at the weekend, as a brain scan revealed that his skull is not cracked. But he added that he had also suffered a broken hand and was \"terribly badly bruised\".\nMr Tsvangirai, leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), was arrested at a prayer rally protesting against the policies of Robert Mugabe's government, which has been blamed for the country's severe unemployment and inflation of more than 1700%. Correspondents reported an astonishing number of broken arms among the injuries of the protesters, indicating a very high level of physical violence when the rally was broken up. Zimbabwean police said that the rally violated a government ban on political protests.\nThose arrested, many of them bandaged and bruised, appeared in the Harare Magistrates Court on Tuesday but were released when the prosecution apparently failed to appear. Mr Tsvangirai and more than 30 activists were then taken to hospital in a convoy of ambulances, watched by about 300 onlookers outside the courtroom.\nInformation Minister Sikhanyiso Ndlovu said that the injuries had been inflicted when Mr Tsvangirai and others attacked police, and that \"killer\" weapons had been confiscated from protesters. A witness told the BBC the activists turned on police after one of their number, Gift Tandare, was shot dead at close range in the chest. But Mr Tsvangirai denied attacking the police, saying \"if there were any skirmishes, it was nothing to do with me.\"\nThe violent arrests were condemned by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, the European Union, South Africa and the United States.

According to data compiled by Iraq Body Count (IBC), a volunteer project that maintains a database of civilian deaths in Iraq from media reports, at least 393 people died in and around Baghdad between February 15 and March 11.\nThe \"New York Times\" estimates 450 Iraqi civilian deaths in and around the capital in the period, using initial reports provided by hospitals and the Iraqi Interior ministry.\nThe Associated Press reports that deaths from bombings have dropped by a third (528 to 370) after the start of the operations. It also reports that the number of bodies found in Baghdad, believed to be victims of sectarian death squads, has dropped from more than 200 a week to about 80 a week.\nAt a separate news-conference, US military spokesperson Major General William Caldwell said the security plan is showing signs of progress. \"The murders and executions have come down by over 50 percent,\" Caldwell said. He did acknowledge that reduced violence in Baghdad's Sadr City neighborhood may be linked to the absence of anti-American Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, who he said was still in neighboring Iran as of 24 hours ago.\nAll this comes as the United States Congress is debating resolutions on re-deploying troops from Iraq. The troop surge has also been in recent debate on whether or not it is the right move as of now. Meanwhile the United Kingdom announced that it would start withdrawing soon. "}

The crater lake is also being reported at a level between 5.7-6.7 metres up the Crater Lake tephra dam.\nThe lahar emergency plan was activated by Civil Defence. The district mayor of Ruapehu, Sue Morris, and conservation minister, Chris Carter, said that the authorities had been very quick to respond to the emergency. All three electronic surveillance technologies had their alarms activated. Mr Carter said, \"The lahar travelled down the path as predicted, and the early warning response system that this government provided worked exactly as planned.\"\nHighways near Mount Ruapehu were closed by the Ohakune police, including the Desert Road. The roads have now been re-opened.\nA lahar has been expected for a long time now, and scientists say the lahar could have been caused by, among other things, the bad weather New Zealand has been having lately.\nSince 1996 the water level in the crater lake at the top of Mount Ruapehu has been rising, which created a risk of a lahar last year."}

More than 550 couples have already registered to make a devotion pledge or renew their wedding vows before municipal officer Wouter Van Bellingen. The alderman called for the event after three couples cancelled their marriage because Wouter is black.\nVan Bellingen, whose Rwandan parents gave him up for adoption, grew up in Sint-Niklaas as the youngest child in a family of 4 adopted children. Van Bellingen is a member of the political party Spirit, which strives for more Flemish autonomy in Belgium. After the 2006 municipal elections in Belgium, he became the first black councillor in Belgium, responsible for civilian, youth and international affairs in Sint-Niklaas. \"The combination of his black skin colour with the shiny white brides dresses will be very photogenic...\" mayor Freddy Willockx predicted when he presented his councillors. One month after Van Bellingen took office, the media reported that three couples refused to be married by a black registrar.\nAt first, Van Bellingen wasn't very surprised. \"As a coloured person, I go through this every day. That's just the reality in Flanders. Only, I didn't expect this to happen so fast.\" After the incident, Van Bellingen got hundreds of calls and letter from people supporting him, including prime minister Guy Verhofstadt, who condemned \"such as stupid form of racism\".\nSocialist mayor Willockx accused the far-right political party Vlaams Belang (Eng. \"Flemish Interest\") of creating the atmosphere for his deputy's experience. Vlaams Belang is second in the polls for the elections next June in Flanders. But, as Van Bellingen pointed out: \"This is not just a problem in Sint-Niklaas, or in Flanders, but all over Europe. And there are racists in every political party here.\"\nSince Van Bellingen made the news, the number of wedding ceremonies he has to lead has doubled, and even bookings for 2008 are coming in. Because many people regretted the fact that they could not be married by the famous alderman, he decided to organise a mass wedding, on the International anti-racism day. Not only future and established couples can take part in the ceremony, but even teens who want to prove their love. \"Anyone can wed that day. I'm not a racist.\"\nSimilar to the television show Fata Morgana, Wouter has 5 challenges for the couples and for the city of Sint-Niklaas: together, they are to realise the biggest wedding pledge, a big wedding photo, a big group hug on the market square, a multicultural dessert buffet and a big first wedding dance."}

The last category, number seven, is called \"most adorable video ever\" and it is to continue the tradition of videos starring cats and dogs while asleep.\nThose that are nominated are able to promote themselves on YouTube during the following five days. These users are also able to plead for votes.\nThe $1.65 billion Google's acquisition gathered a huge number of fans. According to Jamie Byrne, head of YouTube product marketing, 2006 was a pioneering year for sites that rely on user's content. \nHowever, companies like Viacom, believe one category is missing - \"Best Professionally Produced Copyrighted Video.\" Last week Viacom sued Google together with YouTube for more than $1 billion. The lawsuit states that the ever increasing popularity of YouTube is due to a massive uploads of copyrighted videos including \"The Colbert Report\" and \"South Park\"."}

Airbus has warned there could be additional charges to come.\nThese monetary problems have led to a recently-announced restructuring program at Airbus, called Power8, in which 10,000 jobs go and several factories will be sold to Airbus partners. France will lose 4,300 jobs, followed by Germany having a loss of 3,700 jobs, while the United Kingdom and Spain will see 1,600 and 400 jobs cut respectively.\nThe Belgian government has announced that it will give up to 150 million \u20ac (US$ 199 million) in aid to help sub-contractors which supply Airbus and employ thousands of workers."}

It's just causing so much death so quickly that it's startling,\" said acting state apiarist, Dennis vanEngelsdorp who works for the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture.\nAt least 30 to 60 percent of the bees on the west coast of the U.S. have died or disappeared. The east coast and the state of Texas have reported a nearly 70 percent loss of bees. A 20 percent drop in bee population is expected each winter and is considered normal.\n\"Anything above [a] 30 percent [loss] is concerning,\" added vanEngelsdorp.\n\"It\u2019s as high as 100 percent in Texas and one guy in Virginia has 27 hives left out of 1,400 hives. It\u2019s to the point now where we\u2019re starting to contact some crisis management people,\" said David Hackenberg who is one of the largest beekeepers in Pennsylvania.\n\"I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. My hives are just getting emptied. There\u2019s nobody home,\" said beekeeper, David Bradshaw.\nThe bees are reportedly leaving their hives to search for flowers to pollinate, and then never return home. The queen bee, nurse bee and baby bees remain in the hives only to die. Some call it a \"colony collapse disorder.\"\n\"We see dead bee hives with no dead bees and nothing will live in the hive. If I had to guess, 40 percent of the bees along the East Coast are dead since September of last year. In the West Coast, it\u2019s 25 percent and almost everybody is on either coast,\" said a beekeeper in Columbus, Montana, Lance Sundberg who runs the Sunshine Apiary bee hives. Sundberg has said that his bee count went from 5,600 in June of 2006 to less than 3,800 in February of 2007. He says mites might have caused at least half of the loss with the other half unexplainable.\nScientists say that the cause of the deaths and disappearances could be natural causes. Some also say that some bees became disoriented or could have been infected with mites, which could cause a lethal virus to overcome the bees. Other theories include the spread of a bee virus or a possible fungus which could cause them to die, poor nutrition and inbreeding. Scientists say that cell phone towers and crops that have been genetically engineered are not suspected of being a cause.\nThe disappearances could be more serious than they sound-without bees to pollinate crops, in a few years time there could be a dramatic drop in the harvests in the affected states.\nTracheal mites were the cause of a drop in bee population in 1985. After two years passed, the Varroa jacobson mite, which sucks the blood out of the bees, killed nearly 80% of bees in Montana.\nPesticides may also be to blame which could cause the bees to literally get lost on their journey back home.\n\"One-third of the food you eat is dependent upon honeybee pollination. If that one-third doesn\u2019t happen, I don\u2019t know what will occur at the grocery store,\" added Sundberg.\nMontana is the U.S.'s 5th largest producer of honey and exports hundreds of thousands of bees to California to help with the pollination of almond plants.\nOther countries reporting bee disappearances are:"}

This is a major step for the XM/Sirius merger deal, as FCC approval represents a major hurdle for the merger. This document also answers some questions that have plagued subscribers of both services.\nWhile there is not much information for the casual listener, two of the most frequently asked questions have been addressed, at least in part:\nPricing has been clarified, to some exeent. From the FCC filing: \n\"After the merger, customers may elect to receive fewer channels at a monthly price lower than $12.95;\nsubstantially similar programming at the existing $12.95 price; or more channels, including some\nof the 'best of both' networks, at a modest premium to the cost of one service, and considerably\nless than the cost of subscribing to both services.\" The document goes on to explain that channel blocking will be available, and that credit will be given for blocked channels.\nThe filing also addresses the potential need for new receivers. \"Subscribers could continue to use their existing radios or eventually purchase new radios capable of receiving all of the content of both services when they become available.\" Apparently, some programming will be available on both networks, but this will be limited. To get the full range of programming, subscribers will need new equipment.\nAnother major stumbling block for the merger deal is the potential for monopoly. To counter the arguments that the merged company will become a monopoly, the document goes on to describe the nature of satellite radio's competition: HD radio, Internet radio, AM and FM radio, portable media players, mobile phones, and even CD players. \"It is clear that all of the above providers view themselves as being in direct competition\nwith each other,\" the document alleges, and then goes on to quote statements by the National Association of Broadcasters in support of this assertion. \"local radio stations compete for listeners with other forms of audio delivery offering an almost unlimited array of content. IPods and other MP3 players, music [subscription] services, podcasting and the Internet streaming of U.S. and foreign radio stations literally provide content from around the world to listeners in each local radio market in America.\"\nAs this is only the first step in the FCC process, and the FCC is only one of three major steps in the merger process, the deal is far from over. However, convincing the FCC that the merger should happen will remove a major barrier in the companies' efforts."}

The precise cause of death is still being investigated by police and the coroners service, according to Stanton.\nIn late December 2006, the woman had told friends of feeling unwell with flu-like symptoms, and had experienced hair-loss and blurred vision. She died a few days later.\nPills found in the possession of the dead woman were traced back to a purchase the woman made on a health-related website. The death is thought to be the first in Canada caused by pills purchased on the Internet.\nAnalysis of the pills by the Provincial Toxicology Centre revealed that some contained an anti-anxiety drug, obtained normally with a prescription in Canada. In addition, the pills contained a sedative not legally sold in Canada, which has been linked to overdose deaths in other countries.\nOn further testing, the pills were found to contain a non-medicinal filler and revealed the presence of heavy metals, some of which can cause serious illness, according to the Bulletin.\n\"We cannot impress upon the public strongly enough the dangers of buying medications online from a company you don't know,\" said Stanton. \"There is just no way of knowing what you are getting.\"\nThe website in question belonged to a group of companies which, according to the coroner's investigation, change websites and Internet addresses every few days.\nThe B.C.

Small dinosaurs could potentially have withstood severe conditions, such as drought or ... temperature extremes. Survival of terrestrial vertebrates at the end-Cretaceous event has been attributed to sheltering behaviour, with the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs resulting from their inability to find an appropriate cover,\" said Montana State University's chief researcher, David Varricchio.\nThe new dinosaur has been called \"Oryctodromeus cubicularis\" which is being defined as the \"digging runner of the lair.\"\n\"Here we have the burrow, den, an adult with traits for digging, and two juveniles, all in the same place. It doesn't get much better than that,\" said researcher at Emory University, Anthony Martin.\nThe remains were found in an area that was once covered by an ancient flood, but Varricchio states that the flood was not the cause of the dinosaurs death.\n\"The bones are disarticulated; they are not in life position. It's not like they were sitting in the burrow and a flooding event filled the chamber with sediment and they were entombed. They must have died, undergone decay and then the burrow was filled,\" added Varricchio.\nThe fully grown dinosaur is at least 2.1 meters long and weighed nearly 22 to 32 kilograms. Scientists say that the dinosaurs are nearly 95 million years old and are from the Cretaceous period of dinosaurs. In evolutionary terms, the dinosaur lived just before the asteroid impact that made dinosaurs extinct."}

After the incident, Van Bellingen told himself: \"If people don't want to marry, then that's not my problem, it's the problem of those people.\"\nBut then someone gave him the idea to react with a positive signal against racial discrimination. Together with local NGOs and the Center for Equal Opportunities and against Racial Discrimination, he decided to organise a multicultural group marriage happening to, as mayor of Sint-Niklaas Freddy Willockx describes it, \"forge this stupid racist behaviour into an unparallelled positive signal against racism and for tolerance.\"\nA positive signal against racism.\nMayor Willockx told the press about when he first heard about the 3 couples: \"I was angry and ashamed that there were such people.\" He elaborated: \"We are not a racist city. 400 meters from here is a center for immigrants, which was installed without contestation from the city council, in spite of fruitless attempts from an intolerant party to set people up against installation of the center.\"\nWhen asked about the role of the far-right political party , Van Bellingen told Wikinews: \"It's true that a climate of fear has been created, but to blame it on a single party would be too easy. It's the responsibility of all parties.\" Van Bellingen wants to be the councilor of civilian affairs for all citizens, \"not just for those who voted for me.\"\nAlthough Van Bellingen too denies Sint-Niklaas is a racist city, he is often reminded of the colour of his skin. Mayor Willockx gave the example of an incident last Friday, when someone refused to serve him a plate of mussels, because the person mistook the deputy for a waiter.\nIt started small.\nA spokeswoman for the organising committee told the press that it all started with a \"nice little idea\" to have a mass wedding event on March 21, the U.N.-declared . However, they were \"really surprised that the event became something huge.\"\nCouples who wanted to renew their vows or pledge them for the first time could register on the event website. Stijn De Maeyer, a volunteer working on the registrations, told Wikinews that they had to close the online registration when some 692 couples had registered, because of logistic limitations. On the evening itself, he estimated that 1 out of 3 couples who showed up hadn't registered beforehand. There were couples from the Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom and even a couple from Norway. Some of the Belgian couples were immigrants from Nigeria, Ivory Coast, and , according to De Maeyer.\nThe couples.\nWhile singer Axl Peleman, who demonstrated his concern about racial discrimination in on the last October, opened the podium, the couples began to register on the city's Market Square.\nThe symbolic wedding pledge was open to anyone, from any culture, age, or sexual preference. For Van Bellingen, \"Every person who lives in Flanders is Flemish, it doesn't matter if you live here for a month or for generations.\" \nThe couples were from all ages and all layers of society. Some came in their original wedding costume or dress, to relive the moment of their marriage. Even a group of children from a local primary school came to vow eternal fidelity to a classmate.\nOne duo queuing for the registration were two undercover reporters from the Dutch television, who wanted to become \"the two first \"heterosexual\" men to be wed by a black registrar in Belgium\". At the end of the evening, they threw their wedding bouquet off the main stage, shouting: \"Whoever catches this, is not a racist.\"\nMulticultural activities during the event.\nSeveral organisations promoting diversity provided free soup and Arab mint tea to warm the attendees in the rain and cold. Ahmed Hanouch from the sociocultural youth organisation Hid\u00e2ya told Wikinews: \"As new Belgians, we all are looked at differently from time to time. Then we get the feeling we are second-class citizens. The solution is to be open-minded about cultures, like during this event.\"\nFor Ahmed, an event like this one would be welcome each year. Van Bellingen however told the press: \"At the end of the evening, I will drink a pint, and get on with my life.\"\nOn the main stage, several performers from the collective \"The African Stage\" entertained the growing crowd. Speeches, songs and dancing strengthened the message of diversity that the organisation wanted to send.\nSeveral comedy acts followed, such as \"Joeri\", a Flemish television character. To warm up the crowd to say \"I do\", he set the example for registrar Van Bellingen by wedding a special couple; who lived in Sint-Niklaas with their children and who are both deaf. Joeri was assisted by an interpreter for the deaf, who was present all day at the request of Van Bellingen, whose father became deaf some years before he died.\nThe 5 challenges.\nThe culmination of the event came when Van Bellingen held a final speech on the stage, and then started with the symbolic wedding ceremony. He built up the excitement during his speech, explaining that \"excitement is important in a relationship.\" \nThe ceremony was planned for about 8 p.m., but was postponed to allow as many as possible of the couples that turned up to register. Van Bellingen then joined in holy matrimony well over 700 couples. He then demonstrated to the couples how to kiss the bride, by kissing his own wife, with whom he has 2 children. The next challenge, a big group hug on the Market Square, wasn't a problem after the kisses.\nAt that moment, the Flemish radio station Radio 2 took over and started a live DJ set, playing the songs the couples had voted for. The number one wedding dance wasn't Bryan Adams or Clouseau, but \"Ik hou van u\" (I love you) by , a song that already proved popular in 2005 when it was reworked for the celebration of the 175th anniversary of the state of Belgium. \nFor the final challenge, those who like international food could select from the wedding buffet, with desserts provided by local communities such as the Turkish, Syrian, Moroccon and societies, by organisations such as the immigration center. There were also desserts from Mexico, Chile and from the . Together with a wedding cake for 750 people, the organisation hoped to provide for enough desserts for all present, and to end the wedding party in beauty."}

The tunnel would shunt the wastewater to a treatment facility in East London. Some 52 million cubic metres of wastewater streams into the Thames each year.\nAccording to a Parliamentary Statement released March 22, the discharges kill fish, create a higher health hazard for users of the river and reduce the aesthetic appeal of the Thames.\n\u201cLondon today is more densely populated, and the greater urbanisation \u2013 such as the increase in paved areas \u2013 has led to more and faster rainwater run-off and, unfortunately, to an increase in storm overflows into the river,\" said David Owens, Thames Water\u2019s Chief Executive Officer in a press release.\n\u201cLondon\u2019s sewers are one of the great engineering wonders of the Victorian age and have served the capital well for more than 150 years,\" continued Owens.\nThe tunnel is projected to cost a minimum \u00a32 billion and would be considered the largest such project undertaken in Great Britain.\nThe announcement comes after six years of detailed study. Experts such as the Thames Tideway Strategic Study, consultants Jacobs Babtie, and Thames Water played a significant role in determining a solution. All recommended a tunnel under the Thames as the right approach to the problem.\n\"We haven't reached this decision in a vacuum,\" said Pearson. \"A wide range of players have been instrumental in getting us to this point and I thank them all.\" Further work on the project, such as detailed design, planning and funding, will now follow.\nFunding the project, admits Pearson, may put a strain on ratepayers. \"This will inevitably mean some extra costs for customers, but it will deliver tangible benefits for London in the long-term,\" said Pearson.

The law says that it would stop minors from viewing material that is \"harmful by contemporary community standards.\"\nOne advocacy group, Enough is Enough which tries to protect underage children from Internet predators and pornography, spoke out against the ruling.\n\"It\u2019s a very frustrating decision.

The Royal Navy insists that they were operating in Iraqi waters. The Iranian government initially gave the location of the incident as being inside Iraqi waters. After comments from the UK government, Iran gave a revised position for the incident, and the new position provided by the Iranians was outside Iraqi waters and within Iranian territorial waters. The Iranian government then stated that it was not the first time that British ships had entered Iranian waters.\nThe sailors and marines, from the Type 22 frigate HMS \"Cornwall\", had been inspecting, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1723, a ship that was believed to be smuggling cars into Iraq, though it was subsequently cleared after inspection.\nThe incident occurred near the Shatt al-Arab (Arvandrud) waterway, which forms the southern border between Iran and Iraq. Territorial and navigational control over the waterway has been a constant source of friction between the two countries, helping spark the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. \nThe Ministry of Defence said that the Royal Navy personnel had been \"engaged in routine boarding operations of merchant shipping in Iraqi territorial waters\" and had finished their search of the suspect vessel when they were surrounded by Iranian forces. An Iraqi fisherman (who wished to remain anonymous) said that he saw the incident take place in the Ras al-Beesha area near the northern entrance of the Persian Gulf.\nThe British government has demanded the return of the servicemen. Margaret Beckett, the U.K.'s Foreign Secretary said, \"we sought a full explanation of what happened and left the Iranian authorities in no doubt that we expect immediate and safe return of our service personnel and boats.\" The Iranian ambassador was summoned to the Foreign Office to see the Permanent Secretary to the FCO (as the Foreign Secretary was away from London in her Parliamentary constituency at the time).\nThe United States also called for the immediate release of the sailors, supporting the United Kingdom's demand. Sean McCormack, a spokesman for the United States Department of State, said \"we support the British demand for the safe return of their people and equipment.\" The United States also confirmed separately (as reported on the BBC Ten O'Clock News) that it believed the British sailors had been in Iraqi waters.\n\"This is not the first time that British military personnel during the occupation of Iraq have entered illegally into Iran's territorial waters. [The sailors have been] detained by Iran's border authorities for further investigation ... of the blatant aggression into Iranian territorial waters,\" said an Iranian foreign Ministry official according to the television station run by Iran's government.\nIn June 2004, three small vessels and eight Royal Navy personnel were detained by Iranian forces after they allegedly entered Iranian waters on the Shatt al-Arab river without permission. At the time, the story was broken when the capture was announced on state-run Iranian television. British officials only stated that they had \"lost contact\" with the boats, before confirming their detention.\nOn that occasion the men were later released unharmed, but only after being paraded blindfolded on Iranian TV and made to apologise for their role in the incident. The equipment was not returned.\nThe seizure took place on the eve of Saturday's expected vote on a UN Security Council resolution imposing sanctions on Iran for refusing to end its uranium enrichment programme.\nIran recently threatened to seize Coalition military personnel in response to what it claimed was an undercover operation by foreign security agencies to abduct senior officers in its Iranian Revolutionary Guard. Reza Faker, a writer believed to have links with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, wrote in the \"Subhi Sadek\" (the Revolutionary Guard's weekly newspaper), \"\u201cwe\u2019ve got the ability to capture a nice bunch of blue-eyed blond-haired officers and feed them to our fighting cocks. Iran has enough people who can reach the heart of Europe and kidnap Americans and Israelis.\u201d\""}

It is expected around 80,000 vehicles per day will use the tunnel during it's toll-free period.\nDesigners of the tunnel claim it will reduce travel times by as much as 17 minutes.\nThe NSW Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA) has warned motorists that delays may be encountered as drivers get used to the new tunnel and associated changes. Last month the RTA launched a $1.1 million advertising campaign to advise motorists of the changes associated with the Lane Cove Tunnel including a virtual test drive on its website.\nThe tunnel completes Sydney's orbital motorway system, a 110 kilometre stretch of motorways circling the city. The Lane Cove Tunnel connects the Hills Motorway (M2) to the Gore Hill Freeway bypassing Epping Road.\nAssociated with the tunnel are changes to Epping Road (reducing lanes and providing bus lanes), widening of the Gore Hill Freeway and the Falcon Street Gateway.\nThe Falcon Street Gateway is a pair of north facing on/off ramps onto the Warringah Freeway which are tolled at $1.27 for cars.\nBoth the Lane Cove Tunnel and Falcon Street Gateway feature fully electronic tolling and have no cash toll booths."}

This request follows an investigation the ombudsman's office undertook, 3 months ago, into the allegations of theft and fraud carried out by ticket retailers.\nThe results of the investigation into the allegations were detailed in Marin's report, entitled \"A Game of Trust\", released earlier in the day. The OLG has been ordered to transfer relevant files over to the Ontario Provincial Police, to determine whether a criminal investigation is warranted.\n\"The OLG is fixated on profit rather than on public service,\" Marin suggested in his opening statement. \"It is too close to its retailers, who are not just its frontline sales force but some of its best customers,\" he continued. \"It has lost sight of the fact that it is supposed to be a guardian of the public trust.\"\nThe investigation was launched by Marin at his own intitiative, rather than in\nresponse to an individual complaint. Ombudsman investigators looked into the case of Bob Edmonds, a 78-year-old man who was cheated out of a CA$250,000 winning ticket by an unscrupulous retailer, as highlighted in a CBC television expos\u00e9. Over the course of the investigation, the Ombudsman\u2019s Office received more than 400 other complaints related to OLG.\nMarin indicated that, since 1999, \"at least 247 retail owners or their employees have won major lottery prizes\", some of which he acknowledged were legitimate. He also reported that the OLG paid out \"millions of dollars in prizes to retailers making dishonest claims...in amounts anywhere from $250,000 to $12.5 million.\"\nMarin found a systemic pattern of wrongdoing by some retailers, who he deemed to be the OLG's \"partners in profit\", with the OLG overlooking the abuse. Marin suggested that rather than get tough, \"the OLG actually considered relaxing the rules on insiders.\"\nIn his report, Marin proposed 23 recommendations including a zero-tolerance policy for retailer dishonesty, an adjudicative process to deal with disputed prize claims, a retailer code of conduct and the use of \u201csecret shoppers\u201d to test the retailers adherence to it.\n\"We accept the findings of these reports and the organization is moving quickly to implement the recommendations,\" said OLG Board Chair Michael Gough in a news release. \"OLG has learned a great deal from the Ombudsman's report. It is fair, comprehensive and thoughtful,\" continued Gough.\nThe total revenue from lotteries to the provincial government in Ontario for fiscal 2005-2006 was CA$6.36 billion. News of the resignation of OLG's CEO Duncan Brown, was reported just days before the ombudsman's report was tabled."}

The Action d\u00e9mocratique du Qu\u00e9bec (ADQ) are currently in second with 41 seats, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (PQ) are in third place with 36 seats. About 63 seats are required for a majority government in Quebec. The Quebec Liberals won 76 seats in the 2003 election.\nPremier Jean Charest, 48, won a close race for his seat in Sherbrooke, despite having already been declared defeated by a PQ candidate. Quebec's chief electoral officer telephoned the premier to relay the news that he had retained his seat. CBC's French language network \"T\u00e9l\u00e9vision de Radio-Canada\" indicated the initial results were erroneous.\nThe ADQ have won well over the seats needed for them to have official party status. In the 2003 Quebec election they won a total of 4 seats, and would have needed 8 more seats to obtain party status. In the 2003 election, the ADQ garnered 21% of the vote. If the results of the 2007 election holds, with 31% of the vote for the ADQ, it would represent a significant gain for the party.\nThe Liberal campaign, under Charest's leadership, stumbled in the latter stages of the campaign when Charest allotted a $700 million windfall, in the form of a transfer from the federal Conservative government, to tax cuts for Quebecers. The move to apply the money so quickly to tax cuts during the campaign, resonated with some as a cynical move to buy votes, and may have harmed the Liberal chances.\nThe results represent a substantial drop in fortune for the PQ, which entered the election with 45 seats. It is expected that PQ leader Andr\u00e9 Boisclair may be forced to resign the leadership.\nThis is the first minority government in Quebec in more than 100 years since the year 1878. Compared to the 2003 election, voter turnout is up by approximately 3%, according to Elections Quebec.\nStay with Wikinews for the latest updates.

In the end, they were fined $217,000 for their breaches of New Zealand's fair trading act, and will have to publish correcting advertisements.\nIt was first revealed that Ribena did not contain any traces of vitamin C when two 14-year-old Pakuranga College students did tests. At first Anna Devathasan and Jenny Suo thought they had conducted their tests incorrectly, so they tried again, but the same result came up.

The strategy to force the Chinese Government to do something would only worsen the relationship between the two countries.\nThe expert's opinion was it was more important to concentrate on the question what framework of the monetary policy could substitute the fixed exchange rate of the Chinese currency, which helped China in anchoring the inflation expectations.\nMr. Prasad added that the best way to stabilize the Chinese economy would be to couple an inflation objective with a flexibility of exchange rate.\nThe bill needs two thirds of the votes both in the U.S. House of Representatives and in the Senate, in order President George W.

Volunteers handed out flyers about the issue at the Brussels Airport and the Brussels subway and in train stations, companies, hospitals and schools throughout the country.\nThe third edition of the U.S.-inspired Equal Pay Day was called for by the socialist women's organisations \"zij-kant\" and the women-section of the trade union ABVV, in partnership with their Francophone equivalents, PS-women and the union FGTB, the Institute for Equality of Women and Men, the Catholic Worker's Women Movement (KAV) and the union ACV.\nThe Institute for Equality of Women and Men reports that wages are still on average 15% lower for women in Belgium. This figures varies in different studies. In a report ordered by the trade unions, the Higher Institute for Work of the Catholic University of Leuven reports a pay difference of 26%, based on an analysis of the wages of 20 000 men and women. This also results in an inequity in pensions.\nAccording to the Structure of Earnings Survey by Eurostat, the European gender pay-gap mounts to 26%, whereas in Belgium the difference is around 17%. Sweden, Poland, Hungary and Slovenia are doing even better, while in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Cyprus women earn around 30% less.\nThe inequity in payment results from company's human resource management, but is also influenced by the role of the women in the family, education, and so on. But even when these factors are taken into account, there is still a difference of 5 to 7%.\nThe organisations acknowledge that there have been small improvements, and that there have been hopeful political steps since their action last year. Because their target of equal wages for men and woman has moved a little bit closer, they've decided to hold the third edition one day earlier, on March 30 instead of March 31. This date symbolises the 15 months a woman has to work on average to earn the same as her male colleague. In the United States, the difference is bigger, and hence the Equal Pay Day is only held on April 24. The European Equal Pay Day was been held last February 22.\nWith their campaign, the organisation urges politicians to improve the rapports on the phenomenon, to encourage gender-friendly human resource management in businesses, to address gender-issues in the schools, and to keep their previous promises."}

Extremely high temperatures are used to turn the waste into a mildly radioactive glass-like substance, which can be used as a building material. The process also releases an extremely hot mixture of gases that can be used to power steam turbines, generating electricity. The company claims that 70% of this electricity is used to drive the PGM process, while 30% is available as exportable energy.\nEnvironmental impact.\nThe solid waste produced by PGM is resistant to leeching, so there is little danger of radiation contaminating water supplies. However, it remains to be seen how openly companies will accept the use of mildly radioactive slag as a building material, even for use as a road bed filler.\nThe waste gases (hydrogen gas, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen gas, and various hydrocarbons) are produced by pyrolysis of organic substances in the input waste, and are therefore mainly harmless. If they were instead burned in the presence of oxygen, many of the usual pollutants would be produced, such as nitrogen dioxide and dioxin. Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are examples of pollutants that \"are\" generated by PGM, however, so the process cannot be called entirely clean.\nOrigins.\nPGM was developed by EER with the help of Russian scientists from Russia's Kurchatov Institute research center, the Radon Institute in Russia, and Israel's Technion Institute.

The FDA analysis, however, does not confirm the presence of the rodenticide aminopterin, which was reported March 23 by the New York State Food Laboratory.\nAccording to Stephen Sundlof, director of the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, melamine is used primarily to make plastic kitchenware, although it has been used as a fertilizer in Asia.\nSundlof also indicated that the presence of melamine in the urine of cats that died from kidney failure was revealed through testing. He stressed that melamine was not determined to be the source of illness or deaths in the affected animals.\nSundlof suggested that melamine would not be found normally in pet food.\nAt a news conference Friday, Paul Henderson, President and CEO of Menu Foods, indicated that Menu Foods is satisfied that the contamination problem was related to melamine and not aminopterin. \"One week ago, some of the dedicated researchers who had been investigating this matter reported the discovery of a single, toxic compound in our pet food,\" said Henderson in his opening statement. \"That, seemingly, cleared the way for us to address the problem, deal fairly with the pet-owners who had been injured, put our business back together, and move on,\" he continued. \n\"In the intervening week, other top scientists have been unable to validate the findings.

Eisenhower, all three ships will remain in the Persian Gulf if the 15 British sailors and marines being detained by Iran are not released and will also remain if any armed conflict begins between the two nations.\nThe USS Bataan and USS Boxer will also be part of the strike force.\nThe Nimitz strike force will be \"composed of the USS Princeton guided-missile cruiser, four guided missile destroyers \u2013 the USS Higgins, USS Chafee, USS John Paul Jones and the USS Pinckney. The strike force is armed with two helicopter squadrons and a special unit for dismantling sea mines and other explosive devices,\" said Debka according to Russian intelligence officials.\n Despite the claim, Russia's Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov says that the situation will be resolved \"peacefully.\"\n\"We are constantly working on how to resolve the situation around the Iranian nuclear program and other conflicts peacefully. This policy is unchanged and we will pursue it in the future,\" said Lavrov.\nRussian intelligence officials also say that the recent U.S. military exercise in the Gulf on March 27 was \"practice\" for the strike in April and that it will be up the U.S. \"leadership\" to give the go ahead as by April, the military is expected to be ready for the strike.\nDifferent sources agree that the attack is allegedly only going to take place by air and will last 12 hours. No attack by land is expected. The attack is allegedly going to be called \"Operation Bite.\"\nRussia's Defense Ministry refuses to comment on the reports."}

He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but will only need to complete nine months of his penalty, most of it back in Australia, under the terms of his plea agreement.\nHicks, who has been detained for more than 5 years, is to be transferred to Australia within 60 days. The plea bargain also forbids Hicks from speaking to the media for one year after his sentence, suing the U.S. government for alleged abuse during his imprisonment, or appealing his sentence. The deal also mentions that he should not profit from selling his story. These terms were criticised by Michael Ratner, president of the Center for Constitutional Rights, as a \"modern cutting out of his tongue\", with prosecutors using the leverage of a plea deal to stifle information and public debate about the controversial detention process.\nDavid's father, Terry Hicks, responded that he was glad that his son was returning home, but also told Australian Broadcasting Corp.: \nProsecutor Marine Lt. Col. Kevin Chenail asked for the maximum sentence, referring to Hicks by his pseudonym 'Muhammad Dawood'. He told the panel of military officers that, \"Today in this courtroom, we are on the front lines of the global war on terror... The enemy is sitting at the defense table. We are face to face with the enemy... [who was] trying to kill Americans.\"\nAustralian Prime Minister John Howard told reporters in Sydney that:\nAustralian Greens Senator Bob Brown suggested yesterday that the speech restrictions in the plea deal were put in place as a deliberate attempt to meddle in upcoming elections. \"Of course it's a fix,\" said Brown. \"The message has gone very clearly from Canberra to Washington to Guantanamo Bay: don't allow Hicks to be released until after the elections and certainly don't allow him to speak.\"\nHoward disputed that interpretation of events. \"We didn't impose the sentence, the sentence was imposed by the military commission and the plea bargain was worked out between the military prosecution and Mr Hicks's lawyers, and the suggestion...that it's got something to do with the Australian election is absurd.\""}

Tsunami warnings have been issued for parts of Australia as well. \nAccording to the US Geological Survey, the magnitude 8.0 quake struck Sunday, April 1, 2007 at 20:39:56 (UTC) about 45 km (25 mi) south-southeast of Gizo, New Georgia Islands, Solomon Islands, at a depth of 10 km.\n'Disaster' declared in the Solomons.\nThe tsunami was reported as several yards, possibly ten feet, high on the western side of the Solomon Islands and has destroyed at least two villages, leaving at least four people missing and fifteen dead. At least six of those who died were children. The town of Munda reports heavy damage from the tsunami.\n\"Two villages were reported to have been completely inundated. We have received reports of four people missing,\" said Solomon Islands National Disaster Management official, Julian McLeod who also said that communication is difficult because most communication lines are under water.\nThe government of the Solomon Islands reported in a press release, April 2, two confirmed deaths and several others missing in Sasamunga village in South Choiseul. The press release described 10 meters high waves that pushed 500 meters inland. The hospital in Sasamunga village was destroyed by the waves. In addition, nearby villages reported damage to health centres and schools. The premier of Choiseul, Jackson Kiloe, declared his province \"in disaster\" and called on the Solomon government disaster authorities to contact the province.\nRegion on alert.\nTsunami warnings had been issued for Queensland Australia's Barrier Reef Islands and Willis Island in the Coral Sea, as well as South Pacific states. The earthquake was centred 2145 km North-northeast of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.\nAustralia's National Meteorological and Oceanographic Centre in Melbourne warned that a possible tsunami could affect Willis Island at 8.30 a.m. (AEST) and Cooktown about 9.30 a.m. (AEST). The Centre later extended the tsunami warning to Norfolk Island, Lord Howe Island and the whole eastern coast down to Tasmania. People were warned to exit the water and move away from low lying coastal areas. Afterward, at 11:30 am, all fears of the tsunami were put to rest as the Willis Islands reported no tsunami. All warnings for Eastern Australian coasts have been cleared, with no imminent threat perceived.\nJapan's Meteorological Agency is determining whether the Japanese archipelago is at risk of a tsunami, reported the Kyodo news agency. \nAccording to the NOAA/NWS West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Centre, a tsunami has been observed at the following sites:\nThe tsunami amplitudes are measured relative to normal sea level, not crest-to-trough heights. Forecast models indicate the tsunami energy will be mainly contained to the south of the Solomon Islands. A bulletin from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre (PTWC), dated April 2, 2007 01:17 UTC, provided further information. \"Sea level readings indicate a tsunami was generated. It may have been destructive along coasts near the earthquake epicentre and could also be a threat to more distant coasts. Authorities should take appropriate action in response to this possibility.\"\nIn addition, the PTWC suggested that \"when no major waves are observed for two hours after the estimated time of arrival or damaging waves have not occurred for at least two hours then local authorities can assume the threat is passed. Danger to boats and coastal structures can continue for several hours due to rapid currents. As local conditions can cause a wide variation in tsunami wave action the all clear determination must be made by local authorities.\""}

He had declared a week prior to his death that he would not announce the season home opener due to health concerns, but was hopeful to make a return later in the season.\nCarneal's death marks the third consecutive year in which the Twins have started the season with a loss of someone close to the organization; veteran public address announcer Bob Casey died March 28, 2005, and former Twin and Hall of Famer Kirby Puckett died March 6, 2006.\n\"Herb Carneal's voice was the signature element of Twins baseball for multiple generations of fans.

The Minnesota Twins will proudly dedicate the 2007 season to the memory of Herb Carneal,\" Twins President Dave St. Peter said. Last year, Twins uniforms bore the number 34, in dedication to Puckett; to mourn Carneal's passing, the Twins will wear black arm-bands, until a more permanent uniform patch can be designed.\nIn 1998, Carneal cut back his schedule to only include home games, thus avoiding travel, and he was only scheduled to announce 36 home games this season. A 1996 winner of the Ford C. Frick Award, Herb Carneal announced baseball for 51 seasons, and was the \"voice of the Twins\" since 1962. "}

However, this is not the fastest train speed. A Japanese Maglev (Magnetive Levitation Train) reached a top speed of 581km/h (361mph) in 2003. The TGV made history at 13:14 CEST (11:14 UTC). The TGV had been modfied and was called V150 - a TGV with larger wheels than usual and two engines driving three double-decker cars. The vehicle's horsepower was 25,000.\nReporters said the three train drivers were seen grinning on French TV after they realised they had broken the record. The TGV travelled almost as fast as a World War II Spitfire fighter at top speed. Even the electrical tension in the overhead cable was increased 6000 volts from 25,000 volts to 31,000 for the record attempt.\n\"We saw the countryside go by a little faster than we did during the tests,\" engineer Eric Pieczac said.\n\"Everything went very well. There are about 10,000 engineers who would want to be in my place,\" Mr Pieczac said. \"It makes me very happy, a mixed feeling of pride and honour to be able to reach this speed.\" Since their introduction in 1981, TGVs generally travel at about 300km/h (187.5 mph) however, on the recently opened Paris-Strasbourg LGV (\"Ligne \u00e0 Grande Vitesse\" or High-Speed line) trains will travel at 320 km/h (200 mph) \nSNCF and Alstom - the TGV's manufacturer - have said that the record test was performed to see how a TGV would react in extreme conditions - conditions that cannot be performed in a laboratory. \nAfter the record was broken, French President Jacques Chirac conveyed his congratulations on \"this new proof of the excellence of the French rail industry.\" The President also said that \"Economically efficient and respectful of the environment, the TGV is a major asset in efforts to ensure sustainable development in transport\n\"What is important for us today is to prove that the TGV technology which was invented in France 30 years ago is a technology for the future,\" said Guillaume Pepy \nAlstom plans to increase TGV sales abroad, where it is competing with high-speed trains such as the Japanese Shinkansen and the German ICE. Currently, nations of the Far East such as China, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan are the \"top\" customers for high-speed trains. \"Agence France-Presse\" said that a high-speed rail link in between Los Angeles and San Francisco, California was being looked into.

Local news reported that the ship is taking on water after striking a reef in the volcanic island's lagoon, similar to a lake, and issued a distress signal, launching an operation that led more than a dozen ships and five Greek Navy helicopters to evacuate all the people on board, with many boarding a small ferry.\nThe ship was about one nautical mile - 1.8km - from the island's coast when it ran aground. The ship's operators, Louis Cruise Lines, earlier said that a \"controlled evacuation\" was underway, but that \"there is no danger to passengers\". The ship had left the Athenian port of Piraeus on Monday for a five-day tour of the islands. The sea was calm when the incident occurred.\n\"Some passengers have already reached the island and no-one has been hurt,\" an official at the Santorini coastguard has said, whilst Merchant Marine Minister Manolis Kefaloyiannis said to reporters, \"Thankfully, everything has gone well so far. Emergency services responded very quickly and very well.\""}

A number of raids have been made since, with two in September and January 2006.\nA location on Sherwood Ave. in Scarborough, Ontario, and a house on Berard Court in Barrie, Ontario are under a restraining order as they may have drug related crimes.\nThe Toronto chapter of Hells Angels, in the \"Real Deal News\" section of their website, alleged that the police were staging a show for the media and that the raids were overly dramatic to make Hells Angels look bad on television."}

The second video was uploaded as recently as April 5 and the third has been on YouTube since March 12.\nThe government states that the ban on YouTube will continue. Google, who owns \"YouTube\", refused to remove the video saying videos of the current United States president George W. Bush are worse than those of Thailand's King. \n \"That's [the removal of the video] not enough. We want the picture removed too before we unblock it,\" said Thailand's Minister of Information and Technology, Sitthichai Pookaiyaudom who also said that he sent a request to Google to have the image removed from the site, but Google has not yet responded.\n\"It's hard to tell how they [Google] will respond. In some countries, it's a norm to have their leaders mocked, but this is different. With the king, it is very offensive to the Thai public. YouTube said it thought there was not enough reason to remove the clip after viewing the video and making its judgement on the content,\" added Pookaiyaudom.\nGoogle later replied to the King stating that the video will not be removed, but that YouTube has a plan to only allow certain videos to be viewed without blocking the whole site.\n\"He said pulling out those clips would not be an effective way to stop the damage, since users could re-post them again. He said a more effective way would be to block certain pages not to be seen in Thailand. It will be a few days before we lift the ban on the entire site,\" added Pookaiyaudom.\nThe text of the first video, scrolled across the screen, stated \"This video would give up to 15 years prison in Thailand, because their leaders are evil (sic) and hate free speech.

In Thailand, feet are seen as a dirty side of humans and people there think of feet as being offensive and rude. Playing in the background of the video was the music of the national anthem of Thailand.\nIn the second video, posted on March 12, 2007, shows still images of leaders from different nations around the world, King Adulyadej is seen with black painted over his face, imitating thick dark eyebrows and a mustache. \nIn the third video, the feet are again placed just under the King's nose when halfway through the film, his image is vandalized by showing his eyed \"bugged out of his head\" and the Wat Kaow Roop Chang Temple in Songkhla in between his eyes.\nThe first video was viewed nearly 70,000 times before the original user removed it from YouTube."}

In an interview with radio talk show host Laura Ingraham, he said it might even lead to ethnic cleansing in Bahgdad and elsewhere in Iraq.\nGates' comment followed a proposal from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to end most spending on the Iraq war in 2008, limiting it to targeted operations against al Qaeda, training for Iraqi troops and U.S. force protection.\nSec. Gates also said that the duration of the troop increase is not clear and that evaluating whether the Administration's new strategy was working will have to wait till mid-summer. The Army general charged with day-to-day operations has suggested that the increased deployment may extend to early next year.\nCongressional funding.\nGates discussed the military\u2019s need for funding to finance the war effort. He said he is concerned about delays in enacting an emergency supplemental bill. Each house of Congress has passed a version of the bill, and both versions contain a time line for U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq. The House version sets benchmarks of progress to be met by the Iraqi government. President Bush has vowed to veto any bill containing the withdrawal language. \nGates said each of the armed services will be affected by a delay, with the Army being the worst off. The service may be forced to suspend training for deploying forces, repairing equipment and putting in place a civilian hiring freeze. The secretary said a threatened complete cut-off of war \"would be dramatic.\" \nThe Bush administration presents congress with war funding requests as emergency supplementals, not as part of the Pentagon's budget, a practice that began as costs were difficult to estimate during the start of the war. On October 10 of last year, Lt. Gen. David Melcher, deputy chief of staff for Army programming, material integration and management, told reporters that costs were now predictable enough to be included in the Pentagon budget proposals. The Bush administration, however, continues with the use of emergency supplementals. The supplemental funding requests are not accounted in national deficits, which, in the short term, gives the impression of a more positive-looking balance-sheet.\nUntil recently, the Administration had been sending supplemental requests six months after the fiscal year had started, rather than the six months prior to the start of the Pentagon's fiscal year. This meant the military used funds alloted originally for procurement, training and repair, instead for its war efforts during the first six months of the fiscal year. This put pressure on Congress to approve the funding bills quickly to prevent military funding from drying up. Even a separate bridge fund of $50 billion set up to offset the time pressure did not go very far, as $10 billion are used up every month in Iraq and Afghanistan. The 2007 and 2008 supplemental requests were sent to Capitol Hill in February, at the same time as the 2008 Defense Department budget request.\nSecurity situation in Iraq.\nGates said Thursday that increasing troop strength in Iraq and stepping up security in Baghdad is working. \nPlanners predicted the increase in major bombings by insurgents, Gates told reporters at a news conference. He blamed a \"relatively small\" number of people for sectarian killings. An unnamed U.S. military analyst told reporters last month that 70,000 \"hard-line operators and part-time supporters\" were actively resisting the current security operations. \n\"So far, so good\u2026the early signs are positive,\" Gates said. \"There is a great reluctance to engage in happy talk about this. It's a tough environment.\" \n\"One real possibility is if we abandon some of these areas and withdraw into the countryside or whatever to do these targeted missions that you could have a fairly significant ethnic cleansing inside Baghdad and in Iraq more broadly,\" \n\"What we do know is if Baghdad is in flames and the whole city is engulfed in violence, the prospects for a political solution are almost non-existent,\" \nAl Qaeda continues to launch dramatic terror attacks against population centres, Gates said, adding some of these attacks are in reaction to the progress being made.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been part of their strategy since last year to foment sectarian violence,\u201d Gates said. \u201cI think some of these large car bombs are to counteract some of the positive things that have been happening as a result of even the two brigades going into Baghdad along with a significant number of Iraqi forces.\u201d \nGates said he is pleased with the commitment and cooperation from the Iraqi government. The Iraqis have delivered the additional troops they promised, and Iraqi commanders in Baghdad are directing operations. The Iraqi government is allowing Iraqi security forces and coalition forces into any neighbourhood. \nThe Iraqi government also is maintaining its commitment to no political interference in operations, Gates said."}

The boarding crew were linked electronically to HMS \"Cornwall\", which monitored the crew's position continually. \"Let me make it absolutely clear,\" said Carman. \"Irrespective of what has been said in the past, when we were detained by the IRG we were inside internationally recognised Iraqi territorial waters and I can clearly state we were 1.7 nautical miles from Iranian waters.\"\nHaving boarded an unidentified merchant vessel in the Shatt Al Arab waterway, the crew were stopped by two Iranian boats, which prevented them from leaving. \"When we tried to leave, they prevented us by blocking us in,\" explained Air. \"By now it was becoming increasingly clear that they had arrived with a planned intent. Some of the Iranian sailors were becoming deliberately aggressive and unstable. They rammed our boat and trained their heavy machine guns, RPGs and weapons on us.\"\nSix other Iranian boats arrived. \"We made a conscious decision to not engage the Iranians and do as they asked,\" said Air. \"They boarded our boats, removed our weapons and steered the boats towards the Iranian shore.\"\nOn arrival at an Iranian naval base, the UK crew were stripped of their gear, blindfolded, and led to an interrogation room. The following morning the group was flown to Tehran and transported to a prison where they faced \"constant psychological pressure.\" The crew were stripped and dressed in pajamas. According to Carman, \"the next few nights were spent in stone cells, approximately 8'x 6', sleeping on piles of blankets. All of us were kept in isolation.\"\nThey were interrogated most nights and offered two options. \"If we admitted we had strayed, we would be on a plane back to the UK soon,\" said Carman. \"If we didn't we faced up to seven years in prison.\" The crew were kept in isolation until the last few nights, when they were allowed to gather together for a couple of hours at a time.\nOn the subject of deciding to resist the Iranians or not, Air was adamant that it would have made the situation worse. \"Let me be absolutely clear, from the outset it was very apparent that fighting back was simply not an option,\" said Air. \"Had we chosen to do so then many of us would not be standing here today.\""}

This double standard has drawn criticism from the media and families of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nThe 15 sailors were allegedly found and captured in Iranian waters. They caused an uproar in the UK when it was discovered that they revealed information quickly and easily, and were very compliant when asked to write confessions and statements. Retired colonel Bob Stewart mourned the loss of the \"old school\" attitude towards revealing nothing when captured:\nThe government decided that the release of information would lessen the impact of criticism in the media and the popular conception that the troops had easily buckled under the pressure of the Iranian government. \nThe first media interviews appeared on Monday and were published in both the Sun and Daily Mirror newspapers. The payment was not disclosed to the public but reports stated that the amounts paid were 5 or 6 figure sums.\nOne sailor, Faye Turney, the only female in the group, stated that their confessions were forced under duress and the reports from the Iranian governments were false. Her interview came after an Iranian PR maneuver to counter claims that the government mistreated and inhumanely held the captives by broadcasting videos of the 15 watching T.V, eating food, and playing chess. Turney, 25, also stated that she was separated from her colleagues soon after being captured and held in solitary confinement for days on end. This conforms to her colleagues statements, who said that they too were put into solitary confinement and were unjustly treated.\nAnother sailor, Arthur Bachelor, 20 and the youngest in the group, told the Daily mirror that he was led to fear that he was to be executed and expected the worst from his captors and tormentors. These \"soft\" sailors go against a history of \"stiff upper lip\" behavior that was expected from troops in previous generations of soldiers. His officer, Royal Marine Captain Chris Air, has sympathized with his colleagues and believes that they have every right to ask for payment for their stories; he did not accept offers made to him by the media. He believed that telling their stories would \"be part of the process to get things off their minds\".\nThe leader of the captured group, Royal Navy Lieutenant Felix Carman, said he believed that accepting money for their ordeal was wrong. However, he told the media, he doesn't hate people who have been though an awful ordeal, and was fine with their \"making a bit of money out of this\". \nNot everyone was as sympathetic to the released servicemen's ordeal. Families of servicemen and women in Iraq and Afghanistan have cried out in outrage over they way the soldiers handled their capture and the profit that they made out of it. Reg Keys, father of Thomas a soldier killed in Iraq, said:\nThe British Military and Defense Ministry declared the capture and release of the 15 sailors \"exceptional circumstances\" and in their case lifted its policy on banning military members from talking to the media.\nThe former defense secretary of Britain, Micheal Heseltine, believed that it was a great injustice to allow the 15 to ask for payment for their stories:\nFor many people, it is hard to understand why the 15 were so compliant towards the Iranian government, why they so readily gave away information and what happened to the hard-cut, no-nonsense military of past eras. The 15 were well treated when contrasted against former POW's, who suffered horrific torture and punishment without giving up a single word of useful information, and with the emerging videos of the well-treated captured troops, public trust and respect for the military has been struck a horrific blow.\nSources.\n \n "}

It also ended her personal relationship with fellow Conservative MP Peter MacKay. If Stronach had not joined the Liberals an election would have been called. On April 6, 2006, Stronach held a news conference announcing that she would not seek the leadership of the Liberals, which was later won by Stephane Dion.\nIn September, she was caught cheating with former NHL player Tie Domi. In October 2006, Peter MacKay referred to Stranach as a \"dog\". Stronach, a feminist, demanded an immediate apology and said that it offended all Canadian women.\nCTV bureau chief Robert Fife speculated the decision by Stronach, not to seek re-election, may have had something to do with her dissatisfaction over a diminished role in the new Dion caucus. \"She did not have a high-profile critic's role and she had not been prominent in asking questions in question period after Mr. Dion took over,\" suggested Fife.\nStronach has been serving as Critic for Competitiveness and New Economy. She previously served as Critic for the Minister of Transport under interim leader Bill Graham.\nThe public is also questioning Stronach's move to keep her seat until the next federal election, they happen every five years or less. If she had decided to leave her seat completely, an immediate by-election would be called."}

The chlorophyll appears green because it absorbs mainly blue and red light in order to produce food for the plant via photosynthesis, while reflecting the green light frequency.\nScientists at NASA point out that if the stars for other planets were in a different state than our sun and if the light frequency that reached the planets' surface was different, then the plants on those planets would have also evolved a different type of photosynthetic pigment other than chlorophyll. This pigment would be dedicated towards the different light frequencies received by the planet causing the plant to appear a different color from green such as red and yellow.\nCarl Pilcher, director of the NASA Astrobiology Institute, said, \"This work broadens our understanding of how life may be detected on Earth-like planets around other stars, while simultaneously improving our understanding of life on Earth. This approach--studying Earth life to guide our search for life on other worlds--is the essence of astrobiology.\"\nThe research into the color of plants on other planets was started by California Institute of Technology astrobiologist Vikki Meadows and a host of other scientists who were studying how light is absorbed and reflected by plants and some bacteria on Earth. Using this data, a computer model was designed to predict the color of plants and bacteria on other planets.\nNancy Kiang, a biometeorologist at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, noted that it was unlikely any of the plants would be the color blue, \"It appears that harvesting blue light is very common across the board for photosynthetic organisms. I think it is unlikely that anything will be blue.\""}

The Armenian genocide is the second most studied case of genocide after the Holocaust Hitler himself occasionally referred to the extermination of the Armenians, or the lack of prosecution there of, in support for his plan to exterminate the Jews.\nHowever, the Republic of Turkey has long disputed that the event constituted genocide, claiming rather that the Armenian deaths were a result of inter-ethnic strife, disease and famine during the turmoil of World War I.\nThe exhibit was set up in the visitors lobby on Thursday and was due to be opened on Monday by U.N.

A witness said that one of the Asians was attacked after he ran his motorcycle into a crowd. \"BBC News\" reported that a looter was shot dead and a bystander wounded by security guards. \nAsian businesses and a Hindu temple were attacked by rioters; in response, police deployed armoured cars, used tear gas, and opened fire to quell the violence. A group of Asians trapped in the temple by a mob were rescued by police. \nThe sugar company is owned by the Mehta Group, established by Indian immigrant Nanji Kalidas Mehta. Asian immigrants formed a prosperous trading community in Uganda before they were expelled by Idi Amin in 1972. Many returned following Amin's downfall, but some Ugandans view their presence and business with suspicion. \nThe Mabira reserve forest in south-east Uganda covers about 30,000 hectares and is home to several rare species; it has been a reserve forest since 1932. A primatologist working in the area announced in February that monkeys in the forest previously thought to be Gray-cheeked Mangabey (\"Lophocebus albigena\") were in fact a new species. \nPresident Yoweri Museveni's government is considering a proposal to de-notify and transfer 7,000 acres of land to the Sugar Corporation of Uganda Limited (Scoul) to expand its sugarcane plantations. A cabinet paper says the plan will generate 3500 jobs and will contribute 11.5 billion shillings to the treasury.\nScoul bills itself as the largest employer in East Africa, with 7,300 employees manufacturing sugar and industrial alcohol at its 10,000 hectare Lugazi estate. The Ugandan newspaper \"Monitor\" reports that Scoul's plantations have been reduced in acreage after it failed to reach agreement over existing leases with various landlords. \nScoul says that plantations at the Mabira forest will help double its annual production to 110 metric tonnes, and in a newspaper advertisement published on Thursday, said that \"anti-development lobby groups\" were misleading the public about the Mabira plan. In its environment policy, the company says it is committed to a managing land and wetlands resources in an environmentally sensitive manner. \nThe plan is opposed by Ugandan MPs because of its environmental impact. An official from the Ugandan National Forestry Authority told the news agency AFP that the plan will destroy the area's biodiversity and affect locals' livelihood. \nScoul says the forest land is already being encroached upon by subsistence farmers.\nMeanwhile, the group has been offered land in Mengo and by the Anglican church in Mukono as an alternative to the Mabira plan. Scoul Chief Executive S.C Khanna says that he will consider such an alternative if the land is fertile, free of \"squatters\" and close enough \u2014 within 30 km of the sugar factory \u2014 so that the cost of transporting sugarcane is viable. \nScoul has increased security after multiple fires destroyed crops at its plantations.

Despite record profits, up from US$18 million in the same quarter last year to $188 million for the current quarter, the news was dampened by the revelation that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had formalized its investigation into RIM's accounting practices.\nAn internal review by RIM, initiated eight months ago, revealed irregularities with how the company accounted for stock options. On March 5 of 2007, RIM co-chief executive and chairman, Jim Balsillie, resigned his position of chairman, due to the irregularities.\nRIM had indicated, until recently, that the SEC probe into the company's stock option granting practices was an informal inquiry.

Through its internal probe, RIM had determined that the accounting irregularities for recently filed Canadian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) statements would not result in a material adjustment. It would not, therefore, restate Canadian GAAP financial statements, filed previously. \nAside from the record profits just reported, RIM indicated that it had shipped approximately 6.4 million BlackBerry devices in fiscal 2007 and that 1.02 million subscriber accounts were added in the fourth quarter. At the end of the quarter, the total BlackBerry subscriber account base had increased to 8 million.\nOn the news of the formal SEC inquiry, RIM's stock price was down over 8%, Thursday, on the NASDAQ."}

According to the press conference, the shooter shot and killed two people at an on-campus dormitory in a \"domestic dispute.\" He then walked to the other end of the campus and began to open fire on students.\nLocations.\nTwo separate shootings are reported to have taken place; one at 7:15 AM at West Ambler Johnston Hall, a co-ed dormitory, and one at about 9:30 AM EDT in Norris Hall, an engineering building on the other side of the campus. In the week preceding the shooting there had been two bomb threats directed at Virginia Tech; the first at Torgersen Hall, the second at multiple engineering buildings. The university had offered a $5,000 reward for information on these threats.\nPolice do not know if the incidents are connected and are trying to establish a link.\nWest Ambler Johnston Hall.\nTwo people, one male and one female were shot and killed at West Ambler Johnston Hall, in what police initially were led to believe was a domestic incident. That building was secured immediately by police, who had \"reason to believe \" that the gunman had already left the building.\nPolice, who were hiding behind trees and other cover at the time, told students to \"get out of there\". Matt Waldron, a student at Virginia Tech, claims that two students panicked and jumped out of the top story of West Ambler Johnston Hall, which houses at least 895 male and female students out of Virginia Tech's student population of over 26,000. One student broke his leg, while another was described as \"not in good shape\".\nNorris Hall.\nThe second shooting occurred approximately two hours after the first at Norris Hall. In this incident 31 people died, including the gunman. Police indicated that he had taken his own life.\nVideo taken from the cell phone camera of Jamal Albarghouti watches police move into position as 27 shots (some fired in continuous bursts) are fired inside Norris within the small time it was recording. The weapon or weapons involved have been speculated to be either a pair of 9mm handguns or a single 9mm handgun with a .22 caliber handgun, although the police declined to reveal the weapon or weapons used by the shooter.\nThe video also gives a loud bang at the end. This has been speculated to be some kind of an instrument or tactical explosive used by police (the doors to Norris Hall were found to be chained), or whether it is a separate weapon used by the shooter is still unclear.\nOfficials believe that the shooter at Norris Hall was an Asian male in his 20s who was wearing a maroon cap and a leather jacket.\nAftermath.\nThe university has canceled all classes, and is urging students to stay indoors and away from windows, even though the police had already taken one person into custody. The university also requests that \"persons off campus not come to campus\".\nA message posted on the Virginia Tech web page said that classes will be canceled today and tomorrow. Faculty and students have been told to evacuate the campus. All 23 schools in Montgomery County, VA, are on lockdown.\nPresident George W. Bush was made aware of the shootings and according to the White House said, \"thoughts and prayers for those who are dealing with this.\" Senate majority and minority leaders Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell led a prayer service and moment of silence for the faculty, students, and everyone at Virginia Tech during the Senate floor session.

One bullet hit his heart, sending him into cardiac arrest. The attack occurred around 7:50 p.m. local time in Nagasaki.\nAuthorities believe that organized crime is behind the shooting. Immediately after the shooting, police arrested on the crime scene Tetsuya Shiroo, 59, a deputy-leader of the underground organized crime unit, Suishin-kai, and senior member of Yamaguchi-gumi. \nHe reportedly had trouble with the city for failure to compensate for an accident that had occurred a few years ago in which his car had been damaged at a construction site operated by the city's public works department. Police say that during an interrogation Shiroo confessed to the shooting and his intent to kill It\u014d.\nIt\u014d is the fifth politician to be shot in Japan since World War II; a rare occurrence, because gun ownership is banned in Japan."}

He was studying English and lived on the university campus. Meanwhile, a list of confirmed deceased has been released. \nThe President of Virginia Tech, Charles Steger said in an interview that the \"possibility exists\" that more than one gunman was involved. \"It appears that the second shooter was a resident in our dormitory... it appears he was an on-campus resident,\" Steger said. Ballistic reports confirm that the same gun was used in both instances of the campus shootings, but police could not confirm if the shooter was the same.\nThe shootings on Monday were in two separate locations, and occurred two hours apart. The first took place at 07:15 (12:15 UTC), at West Ambler Johnston Hall dormitory. Then, at about 09:15 (14:15 UTC), 30 people were killed in the second shooting, about half a mile (800 metres) from the first at the Norris Hall classroom building, on the same campus. Bodies were found in four classrooms and a stairwell, according to Virginia state police superintendent Col. Steve Flaherty.\nSome students complained that they had received no warning from the university until an e-mail alert sent more than two hours after the first incident. The university has suspended classroom courses for one week, and Norris Hall will remain closed for the rest of the semester. University officials have expressed an interest in developing a text messaging alert system where persons can add their phone number to a list for notification in the event that incidents may warrant the use of caution or extra attention.\nIn a reaction to the school massacre, the gun control group Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence asks for \"common-sense actions to prevent tragedies like this from continuing to occur\". The New York Times ran an editorial with a similar message for gun control.\nAlleged lover's quarrel at West Ambler Johnston Hall dormitory.\nA Virginia Tech student, Chen Chia-hao, told the Taiwanese station CTI TV that he believed the shooter in the West Ambler Johnston Hall was a Chinese student. The first victim was, according to Chen, his girlfriend. Chen said: \"They had a big quarrel in the West Ambler Johnston Hall and he shot her. Then the RA (dormitory supervisor) came, and he shot the RA.\"\nAccording to Chen, the gunman locked up 25 students who were taking a German class in the Norris Hall building. The man then shot himself in the head, making it difficult for him to be identified, Chen told CTI TV.\nWitness reports from the Norris Hall classroom building.\nFirst-year student Erin Sheehan was one of the only 4 students coming out of the shooting in the German class unharmed. Erin explained how \"(The gunman) peeked in twice, earlier in the lesson, like he was looking for someone, somebody, before he started shooting.\"\nThe gunman first shot German lecturer Christopher James Bishop in the head. Then, he fired some 30 shots in the class and went on. Trey Perkins and two other students decided to hold the heavy wooden classroom door shut with their feet.\nErin Sheehan explain how they heard \"something like drilling in the walls\", and how they closed the doors to prevent anyone from entering the classroom. Three times the gunman returned and fired in the door, while the students tried to keep him out. Erin describes how \"He seemed very thorough about it, getting almost everyone down. I was trying to act dead. He left for about 30 seconds, came back in, did almost exactly the same thing.\" Trey Perkins explained how \"Fortunately, we were lying down and weren't in front of the door.\"\nIn a nearby classroom, students decided to jump from the second floor through the window, and ran for safety to a nearby window."}

Of these, 90 would be elected from ridings under the existing first past the post (FPTP) system. The remaining 39, however, would be \"list members\" (not associated with specific regions) publicly nominated in advance by parties and assigned so that each party's total representation was in proportion to its share of the popular vote.

BCE is one of the most widely held stocks in Canada. \nBCE revealed that the potential takeover group includes the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec, and Canada's Public Sector Pension Investment Board. Each of the pension funds involved have signed non-disclosure and standstill agreements with BCE.

In addition, BCE may retain the status quo if it does not receive a bid that it feels would enhance shareholder value.\nOne other pension fund that has expressed interest is the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan (OTPP). \"We are pleased that this process is not exclusive and we will continue to review our options, including leading an alternative Canadian consortium,\" said Jim Leech, Senior Vice-President, Teachers' Private Capital. OTPP is currently BCE\u2019s largest single shareholder, with an approximate ownership stake of 5.3 percent.\nBCE, as Bell Canada, has been in business for 127 years. It provides phone service, satellite television, Internet access, wireless services, and other technologies to residential and business customers.\nIf analyst estimates are accurate, the sale of BCE could be worth about CA$32 billion or roughly $40 per share.

{"id": "65722", "revid": "10144", "url": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=65722", "title": "Electronic voting disputed in France", "text": "In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating their candidate of choice into an envelope. After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting roll. French electoral law rather strictly codifies the proceedings. Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that no envelopes are present at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those of the duly counted and authorized voters. Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under heavy supervision, following specific procedures.\nIn the past, voting machines, though authorized by law, were scarce. But this year, during presidential elections (the first round was April 22, the second is on May 6), the country is shaken by controversy about the machines intended to count about 1.5 million votes.\nAs in the United States, there is a group of academic computer scientists that oppose voting machines. They argue that voting machines replace a public, easily understandable counting process, where large-scale fraud would entail large-scale corruption, by an opaque process where votes are counted by machines that voters have to blindly trust. Voting machines have to be approved by the Ministry of the Interior, but this approval is based on confidential reports by private companies. Opponents to the machines point out that the Ministry was long held by Nicolas Sarkozy, who happens to be the leading candidate. Opponents also list a number of weaknesses and discrepancies that have occurred in other countries using voting machines.\nAll main political parties except UMP, Mr Sarkozy's ruling party, oppose the voting machines. Some citizens have filed for court injunctions against the voting machines. Opponents have given detailed instructions that voting witnesses should check whether the machines correspond exactly to an approved type, including software versions, and fulfill all legal conditions. In a sign of the frenzy over the issue, on April 12 the Ministry of the Interior issued a last-minute authorization for a specific model (hardware, firmware). The stakes are high: votes on unapproved machines should be canceled by the Constitutional Council for the official count.\nThe opposition has crystallized on the Paris suburb of Issy-les-Moulineaux. Issy's mayor, Andr\u00e9 Santini is a well-known technophile; his city organizes a \"World E-Gov Forum\". Here too, last minute fixes are at work. The machines delivered to the city are of a yet-to-be-approved type. The manufacturer, the American company ES&amp;S voting systems, is now delivering older 2005 machines. \"Le Monde\" reports that other municipalities have already replaced their recent machines by an older, approved, model.\nProponents of the machines, such as the French company France \u00c9lection, claim they are being defamed and dispute the competence of their critics. Elected officials supporting the machines claim the machines save on paper, time, and the need to find volunteers to count votes."}

The 5-4 vote reflected the change in vote count resulting from the retirement of Justice O'Connor and the confirmation of Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito.\nThe Intact dilation and extraction procedure, also known as partial birth abortion, involves removing an intact late-term fetus from the womb via the cervix. While it is a relatively rare operation - 0.17% of all abortions in the US in 2000, it has become a focal point in the abortion debate.\nThe Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act bans the procedure in cases where the fetus is terminated during the operation, unless it is performed to to save the life of the mother.\nJustice Kennedy wrote in the opinion of the court: \"respondents have not demonstrated that the Act would be unconstitutional in a large fraction of relevant cases.\" Further, he said, \"Respondents have not demonstrated that the Act, as a facial matter, is void for vagueness, or that it imposes an undue burden on a woman\u2019s right to abortion based on its overbreadth or lack of a health exception. For these reasons the judgments of the Courts of Appeals for the Eighth and Ninth Circuits are reversed.\"\nIn a concurring opinion, Justice Thomas stated that he joins \"the Court\u2019s opinion because it accurately applies current jurisprudence, including Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (1992).\"\nIn dissent Judge Ginsburg wrote: \"Today\u2019s decision is alarming. It refuses to take Casey and Stenberg seriously. It tolerates, indeed applauds, federal intervention to ban nationwide a procedure found necessary and proper in certain cases by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\"\nJustice Kennedy's words also recall the complicated issues of standing related to such cases. An issue in Roe v. Wade was the impossibility of any individual having standing in a court proceeding regarding abortion rights, since court proceedings take more than the 9 months of pregnancy, retiring any individual plaintiff's standing before an appeals process can take place. The criterion of \"a large fraction of relevant cases\" may effectively deny standing to any plaintiffs who wish to litigate particular restrictions in some relevant future cases."}

The same market was under re-construction after it was targeted in February by a bomb which nearly destroyed it. 135 people were killed in that attack.\nJust after the blasts, the Iraqi Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki had the Iraqi army colonel in charge of the Sadriyah district arrested and called those responsible for the blasts \"soldiers of Satan.\"\n\"This monstrous attack... did not distinguish between the old and young, between men and women. It targeted the population in a way that reminds us of the massacres and genocide committed by the former dictatorship,\" Maliki told reporters.\nAl-Qaeda in Iraq is believed to be responsible for the attacks, though no one has claimed responsibility."}

It may have even looked like many palms trees that exist today, but did not have any leaves. Instead they had fronds much like a fern.\n\"These were very big trees. Our reconstruction shows them to be a lot longer and much more treelike than any of the reconstructions before. I don\u2019t think any of us dared think of them being quite that big,\" said paleobotanist at the State University of New York at Binghamton, and one of the researchers who studied the tree, William Stein.\nOver 130 years ago in 1870, the same kind of trees, but only the stumps, were also found in Gilboa after flood waters caused the stumps to be exposed. A few decades later in the 1920s, another set of stumps were found in the same area.\nIn 2004, the researchers found a top to one of the trees that weighed almost 400 pounds not too far from Gilboa.\nResearchers say that these trees likely shaped the forests of Earth as we see them today, and that the trees existed long before dinosaurs were roaming the planet.\n\"In forming the first forests, they must have really changed the Earth system as a whole, creating new types of micro-environments for smaller plants and insects, storing large amounts of carbon and binding the soil together. The rise of forests removed a lot of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This caused temperatures to drop and the planet became very similar to its present-day conditions,\" said the leader of the research team, Christopher Berry.\nWattiezas were most common during the Devonian period and existed on the planet before fish evolved sufficiently to leave the seas."}

The ships and their crew had been participating in the annual seal hunt off Canada's easternmost province.\nSeveral of the vessels have been damaged by the ice and supplies are now running low for those sailors awaiting rescue by the Canadian Coast Guard. As of Thursday, 6:00 p.m. EDST, some 20 crew members, out of an estimated 400, had been rescued.\nA Coast Guard icebreaker, the Sir Wilfred Grenfell, on mission to free the trapped ships, itself became stuck in the ice. A Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) spokesperson indicated to CTV News that, although the Grenfell had since been freed, another icebreaker, the Ann Harvey, was now trapped. \"It's just such heavy ice that even ice breakers are having trouble,\" said Erika Pittman, a communications officer with the DFO. \nIn addition to the crushing ice, extreme weather conditions have been hampering rescue efforts. Pittman suggested that conditions wouldn't improve until sometime next week. The amount and thickness of the pack ice, according to Pittman, is the worst it has been for sealers in the past 15 years.\nIn addition to three icebreakers on hand, the Coast Guard is flying helicopters in to provide food and support to the stranded sailors. Most of the sealing ship captains have refused to abandon their ships, instead staying with them and hoping for a change in conditions or to be freed by the Coast Guard.\n\"Usually you try to stay with the ship because you think the safety is with the ship because the ship is big, but sometimes it is too late. In this case, we're hoping that as it changes and the breakers and helicopters are there and we can get them all out,\" said Brian Penney, a superintendent with the Coast Guard.\n\"They're putting a lot of effort into pulling them out,\" said Penny. \"But the sheer numbers, it's a very, very slow process.\" According to Penny, approximately 15 of the longliners ships have had their hulls damaged by the ice to the extent that the ships are at risk of sinking.\nCritics of the seal hunt point out that the annual hunt is not only \"cruel to animals\", but is also a dangerous occupation for the sealers. When sealers have to be rescued by the Coast Guard, \"Canadian taxpayers foot the bill,\" suggested Rebecca Aldworth, director of Canadian wildlife issues for the Humane Society of the United States."}

Phillips barricaded himself on the second floor of the two-story building, with David Beverly and another female hostage. The building was evacuated and police were summoned. NASA security, Houston police and a SWAT team were on the scene.\nHouston news reported at 5:22 p.m. CDT that Bill Phillips, the gunman, and David Beverly, the hostage, were both dead. Police reported that the SWAT team heard one shot and decided to engage, but before they reached the room they heard another shot. When SWAT reached the scene, the male hostage was dead from a bullet to the chest, the gunman was dead from a bullet to the head, and the female hostage, Fran Cranshaw, was gagged and bound to a chair with duct tape, but was otherwise unharmed.\nAll NASA employees had first been warned to stay in their buildings but were later told by NASA they were free to go home if their working day was over.

At least three samples from the feed used to feed the pigs were tested and those results also came back positive for melamine.\nReports say that at least 100 pigs from the farm were slaughtered and sold from the \"custom slaughterhouse\" that is operated on the farms site. The meat is then sold to different places as \"individual orders\" and is not sold commercially for supermarkets. The affected meat goes as far back as April 3 and the company is asking anyone who bought it to return the product or throw it out.\nDespite the sale, California State Veterinarian Dr. Richard Breitmeyer says that no evidence has turned up to suggest that the meat that was sold entered the human consumption chain.\n\"There is no evidence that any products from this farm have entered the food supply. The risk to people right now is minimal,\" said Breitmeyer who also said that pet food from bags or boxes that have been torn or ripped, is sometimes reused as feed for small farms.\nCalifornia's Department of Food and Agriculture investigated the company and found that it had received the contaminated pet food from Diamond Pet Foods, which supplies retailers with the pet food Natural Balance, one of the over 100 recalled brands of pet food. Authorities then quarantined the farm to further investigate the situation.\nAt least 1,500 pigs are on the farm.\nAs of the moment, no other farms are being investigated, but officials say that other farms may also be affected.\n\"In the course of our investigation, we may find similar situations in other parts of the country,\" said head of the Center for Veterinary Medicine at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Stephen Sundlof.\nThe FDA is continuing to investigate and Sundlof says that there is a possibility that the contamination of the pet food may be intentional.\n\"It would certainly lend credibility to the theory that it may be intentional. That will be one of the theories we will pursue when we get into the plants in China,\" said Sundlof.\nLast month, Menu Foods was the first to recall all of its 60 million products of dry and wet dog and cat food after pets began to fall ill and in some cases died of kidney failure. The FDA found melamine in samples of Menu Foods pet food and in samples of wheat gluten, imported from China, which was used as an ingredient."}

Erdo\u011fan said that G\u00fcl was \"the person who emerged at the end of our evaluations as the candidate to become Turkey's 11th president.\"\nBoth the current president, Ahmet Necdet Sezer, and the influential head of the Turkish Armed Forces, General Ya\u015far B\u00fcy\u00fckan\u0131t have stressed that the new president must defend Turkey's secular values. To that end G\u00fcl said: \"the president must be loyal to secular principles... The president must be bound by the basic principles of the constitution... If I am elected I will act accordingly.\"\nThe main opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), hinted that it may nominate its own candidate to challenge G\u00fcl."}

The first on February 19, off the coast of Mexico, March 18 off the coast of Panama and on March 25, also off the coast of Panama.\nIn the first bust on February 19, \"the Ecuadorian-flagged fishing vessel Don Juan K was approached in the Pacific Ocean February 19 off the coast of Mexico while allegedly offloading cocaine into \"go-fast\" (cigarette-style boat) boats. The fishing vessel's crew apparently set fire to Don Juan K in an attempt to destroy the evidence and flee in the go-fasts. The USCGC Sherman stopped the go-fasts and recovered about 900 pounds of cocaine as Don Juan K sank. The 14 crew members are being processed for further legal action,\" said a statement on the USCG's website.\nThe second bust on March 18 yielded nearly 40,000 pounds of cocaine.\n\"The 330-foot Panamanian-flagged motor vessel Gatun was interdicted in the Pacific Ocean Mar. 18 off the coast of Panama while heading north toward the United States. Sherman's crew stopped and boarded the vessel and found 765 bales of cocaine weighing approximately 38,000 pounds in two shipping containers. Gatun was escorted back to Panama and its 14 crew members processed for further legal action,\" added the statement.\nIn the third bust on March 25, at least 2,000 pounds of cocaine was seized, also from a ship off Panama's coast.\n\"[The] Sherman's crew stopped and boarded a small stateless go-fast in the Pacific Ocean Mar. 25 off the coast of Panama following a short chase, in which, the go-fast attempted to flee at a high rate of speed. Approximately 2,000 pounds of cocaine was found aboard the go-fast and its four crew members were processed for further legal action,\" said the statement.\nSeveral agencies both in the U.S. and in other countries in Central and South America and will continue to investigate the extent of the drug ring.\n\"The Coast Guard works in close coordination with Joint Interagency Task Force South, U.S. Attorney's office, Panama Express South, DEA, FBI, Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Customs and Border Protection, as well as the Departments of Justice, State and Homeland Security on counter drug operations in the Pacific Ocean near Central and South America. These drug smuggling routes are some of the most active, yielding roughly 70 percent of the cocaine seized annually by the Coast Guard,\" added the statement."}

The incident began at about 2:00 pm and order has since been restored. Two prison employees have sustained injuries.\nLocal newspaper reports also say for a short time inmates took over the prison. Inmates also set fires and the fire department was called. Police have been trying to get all inmates back into their housing rooms. They used tear gas to disperse the prisoners and no shots were fired. Tear gas is used to loosen crowds, especially during large protests. It can cause irritation or disabling physical effects.\nThe Mayor of New Castle, Indiana, Tom Nipp, dispatched all of the city police officers to the prison to protect the safety of the residents. State Police were also called in by prison officials to assist in putting down the riot.\n\"We are quickly collaborating with local law enforcement to properly handle the New Castle Correctional Facility situation,\" said Commissioner J. David Donahue. \"We will keep the public updated as more details unfold.\"\nNipp called the disturbance, \"A full scale riot.\"\nWithin the last 24 hours prior to the uprising, new inmates from Arizona had been transferred into the facility. Recently, the states of Indiana and Arizona reached an agreement in which Indiana would house prisoners from Arizona in its prison system to decrease overcrowding in Arizona prisons. The prison was built in 2002 and can house about 2,200 inmates. It currently has about 1,000 from Indiana and 600 from Arizona."}

Among the alleged offences are a first-degree murder charge in the shooting death of Constable Daniel Tessier, attempted murder in the wounding of Tessier's partner, Stephane Forbes, and several weapons offences. Parasiris will remain free on bail pending a preliminary hearing to be held in August of this year.\nFor his part, Parasiris has not denied that the shooting took place, and has apologized to Tessier's family. He claims that he was acting in self defence, as he didn't know that it was police entering his house in a planned raid, and instead believed intruders had broken in. \"I'm really, really sorry (about) what happened. My condolences to the Tessier family,\" Parasiris told CTV News. \"I honestly thought there was a home invasion or something.\"\nThe judge overseeing the bail proceedings, ruled that Parasiris would not pose an immediate threat to society, but did place strict conditions on his release. While awaiting trial, Parasiris, 41, will have to live with his father, obey a curfew, and not travel outside Canada.\nIn what is believed to be the first ruling of its kind in Canada, releasing on bail a defendant charged with killing a policeman, the judge criticized some of the police tactics used during the raid. Justice Jean-Guy Boilard of the Quebec Superior Court noted that the police didn't use a \"knock notice\" before entering Parasiris' house, but rather used a battering ram to break down the door. When serving a warrant under normal conditions, police are to knock at the door and identify themselves. Jacques Larochelle, Parasiris' lawyer, indicated that he will contest the warrant's legality.\nThe prosecution argued that, even if it was not clear to Parasiris that police were entering his home, he should not have been so reckless with a gun.\nDuring the fatal raid on the Parasiris home in March, police collected four loaded handguns, as well as a small amount of drugs and cash. According to reports, the 357-magnum handgun allegedly used by Parasiris to shoot the officers was legally registered."}

A hundred thousand died in the battle, remembered every year as ANZAC Day by both nations.
