Use of the gesture as a form of protest began last weekend in Bangkok, the capital of the country. \nThis form of protest has drawn the attention of Thailand's military junta, the , who announced its intent on Tuesday to arrest protestors who display the gesture, in violation of orders to stop. Speaking on behalf of the junta, Colonel Weerachon Sukhondhapatipak said to the Associated Press, \"At this point we are monitoring the movement. If it is an obvious form of resistance, then we have to control it so it doesn't cause any disorder in the country.\" In a comment to the , Thai army Colonel Winthai Suwaree shared a similar sentiment: \"[The junta] must look at [the protester's] intention, what they want to communicate and surrounding circumstances\".\nFollowing the ousting of Thailand's elected government in reportedly the fourteenth coup experienced by the country since the adoption of constitutional monarchy in 1932, the country remains affected by a curfew spanning midnight to 4am, with only Phuket, and exempted, as they are beach resorts frequented by tourists, a group for whom the junta made the move in a bid to avoid adverse effects to the country's tourist industry. \nNonetheless, in the wake of the coup, the United States (DoS) advised \"U.S. citizens reconsider any non-essential travel to Thailand, particularly Bangkok\". The DoS also informed US citizens to stay away from groups of protestors, citing that \"even demonstrations that are meant to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.\" Other restrictions placed on citizens by the junta include internet censorship and restrictions on television broadcasts. Also banned were assemblies of five or more people with political intent.\nSolitary displays of the gesture was among a few forms of protest utilized by the Thai people in Bangkok on Sunday, amid the placement of almost 6000 soldiers and police officers by the junta in an effort to suppress protests. Other displays of defiance included protestors banding together in flash mobs or peacefully walking through the central shopping district donning masks in an attempt to bypass security forces stationed there.\nThe gesture finds its origins in \"The Hunger Games\" series, where it was a sign of thanks, admiration, and farewell to a loved one, later gaining significance, in the second book \"\", as a symbol of rebellion against the totalitarian government of Panem. Protesters, however, have found their own ways of deriving meaning behind the gesture, with some reportedly interpreting it as standing for , values popularized by the . \nA purported alternative interpretation by protesters held the gesture stood for freedom, election, and democracy. Still others have created a photo montage of the gesture with a picture from the source movie, which circulated online, with the caption \"1. No Coup, 2. Liberty, 3. Democracy\" written on the three extended fingers. Manik Sethisuwan has taken to Twitter with this message: \"Dear #HungerGames. We've taken your sign as our own. Our struggle is non-fiction. Thanks.\"\nSombat Boonngam-anong, a social activist who has made efforts to rally the Thai people in continued protest, offered his own interpretation of the gesture on Facebook. \"Raising three fingers has become a symbol in calling for fundamental political rights\". Sombat belongs to the \"\", a protest group which has supported Shinawatra's government and the earlier government of Thaksin Shinawatra, her brother, and conducted protests amid prosecution by the junta. Sombat advocated a form of silent protest, raising of their right arms, \"3 fingers, 3 times a day\" for 30 seconds at 9 a.m., 1 p.m., and 5 p.m., in public locations where police officers and the military are absent. \"Let's escalate the anti-coup movement three times a day together,\" said Sombat. \nWeerachon expressed awareness of the gesture's origins, stating \"We know it comes from the movie, and let's say it represents resistance against the authorities. [...] If a single individual raises three fingers in the air, we are not going to arrest him or her. But if it is a political gathering of five people or more, then we will have to take some action. If it persists, then we will have to make an arrest.\" On Sunday, protestors were reportedly detained for that reason. \nThe decision to criminalize displays of the gesture have drawn the criticism of Human Rights Watch, stating it expresses \"a mindset that views human rights with disdain, and sees youthful defiance as the enemy.\" Human Rights Watch's Asia director, Brad Adams, remarked: \"The Thai military's assault on basic human rights has apparently grown to not only target peaceful protesters but now also silent ones as well \u2014 since now just holding up an arm with a three-finger salute is enough to earn the junta's ire\".\nThe National Council for Peace and Order has stated it imposed military rule over the country due to political deadlock resulting from demonstrations spanning seven months, which occasionally erupted into violence. Last year, on the volatile political situation in Thailand, scholar Nicholas Farrelly wrote in the : \"Each year, Thailand tends to experience at least one period of frenzied coup speculation. Coups clearly still play a major role in Thai mainstream politics.\""}

This, in turn, produces an upward motion of the overlying . These parcels move westward aloft and then sink again in the eastern equatorial Pacific, where their sinking creates a high pressure system. The resulting Atlantic\u2013Pacific pressure difference strengthens the Pacific trade winds.\"\nCoauthor Malte Stuecker of the Department reports that \"Our study documents that some of the largest tropical and subtropical climate trends of the past 20 years are all linked: Strengthening of the Pacific trade winds, acceleration of sea level rise [three times faster than the global average] in the western Pacific, eastern Pacific surface cooling, the global warming hiatus, and even the massive droughts in California\". His colleague cauthor Fei-Fei Jin adds, \"We are just starting to grasp the scope of the impacts of this global atmospheric reorganization and of the out-of phase temperature trends in the Atlantic and Pacific regions\".\nWork earlier this year by coauthor Matthew England, University of New South Wales, showed the stronger winds have churned up the waters of the , so more heat flows from the winds into the water. This appears to explain why global surface temperatures have recently risen more slowly.\nCoauthor Axel Timmermann of the University of Hawaii notes a further amplifying effect: \"Stronger trade winds in the equatorial Pacific also increase the upwelling of cold waters to the surface. The resulting near-surface cooling in the eastern Pacific amplifies the Atlantic\u2013Pacific pressure , thus further intensifying the trade winds [...] It turns out that the current generation of climate models underestimates the extent of the Atlantic\u2013Pacific coupling, which means that they cannot properly capture the observed eastern Pacific cooling, which has contributed significantly to the leveling off, or the hiatus, in global warming.\"\nAs Professor England said, \"It will be difficult to predict when the Pacific cooling trend and its contribution to the global hiatus in surface temperatures will come to an end. [...] However, a large event is one candidate that has the potential to drive the system back to a more synchronized Atlantic/Pacific warming situation.\""}

However, its low and low ratio (a very smooth surface at centimetre to decimetre scales) showed that it cannot be an E-type asteroid.\nUnusually for an (which are mostly ), 1950DA has low . It would have been puzzling, if it was not for the observations of 21 Lutetia, which is also an with very similar low .

Unlike Itokawa, 1950DA does not have large s on the surface; they may have been lost as 1950DA's rotation accelerated due to . This effect results in a change of the rotation rate of an asteroid (either faster or slower), and is caused when the heats up an object unevenly, due to asymmetric surface . As the heat escapes, the rotation rate is slowly changed due to an uneven rate of cooling. The researchers find that a rubble-pile asteroid may have a high rotation rate, if it is held together by cohesive forces between the grains. But as the spin rate increases due to YORP effect, the centrifugal force may cause the rubble pile to eventually separate as it happened with .\nThe findings may have implications for . A very small impulse may break one into several pieces. As Ben Rozitis said: \"You'd want to avoid interacting with the asteroid directly.

In the test given to both groups, both had a roughly 20% error rate. The study \"Passport Officers' Errors in Face Matching\" was published in \"\" this Monday.\nPrevious research has shown difficulty of deciding if two photographs are of the same stranger or of two different unfamiliar people. As coauthoring psychologist Dr David White says, \"Despite this, photo-ID is still widely used in security settings. Whenever we cross a border, apply for a passport or access secure premises, our appearance is checked against a photograph\".\nIn the person-to-photo test, 30 officers \u2014with mean age 48.0, 21 of them female\u2014 in Sydney Passport Office, during a normal working day, had to compare photograph (presented for up to ten seconds) to the person present. 34 students, 17 of each gender, were recruited as 'applicants' for the identification task. The person-to-photo test could not be given to a control group because it was not possible to bring back the 'applicants' to repeat the test.\nID cards were generated, genuine and 'fraudulent', for each 'applicant'. Photographs of the 'applicants' were just a few days old. Each applicant's 'fraudulent' photo was subjectively chosen for greatest similarity to their genuine photo.\nThe 'applicant' did not know whether the ID they presented was genuine or 'fraudulent', to avoid giving any to the passport officers. The passport offers rejected 6% of the genuine photos and accepted 14% of the 'fraudulent' ones, for 10% wrong decisions overall.\nAs coauthor Rob Jenkins, a psychologist at the University of York, said: \"This level of human error in Australian passport office staff really is quite striking, and it would be reasonable to expect a similar level of performance at UK passport control. [...] At Heathrow Airport alone, millions of people attempt to enter the UK every year. At this scale, an error rate of 15 per cent would correspond to the admittance of several thousand travellers bearing fake passports\".\nOne week later, 30 officers in Sydney Passport Office took the short version of (GFMT); 28 were participants from the person-to-photo test, and two were replacements for officers from the earlier test who were absent from work the day of the second test. GFMT performance predicted performance on the person-to-photo test for mismatches, but not for matches. The researchers suggested this could be explained by an upper limit on how accurate person-to-photo match trials can be.\nThe face matching accuracy was found to be independent of experience and training. As Dr David White says, \"passport officers did not perform better, despite their experience and training. They made a large number of errors, just like the untrained university students we tested\".\nTwo years later, the photo-to-photo test was conducted, with images supplied by 21 'applicants' from the person-to-photo test. 27 passport officers \u2014mean age 45.5, 10 of them participants from the person-to-photo test, 22 of them female\u2014 as well as 38 volunteers \u2014mean age 18.9, 26 of them female\u2014 compared photos taken recently to photos either from two years earlier or from official identification documents. All variations on the trials taken together produced 84 trials, ordered randomly. The testing was again done at the Sydney Passport Office, without time restriction, to encourage accurate response.\nA possible solution of the problem is recruitment of staff with high face-matching accuracy, as Dr David White notes: \"But we observed very large individual differences. Some passport officers were 100 per cent accurate. This suggests security could be significantly improved by using aptitude tests to select staff for jobs involving photo-ID checks. Because of this study, the Australian Passport Office now sets face-matching tests when recruiting staff and when selecting facial comparison experts\".\nMatch accuracy tested lower with official identification photos than with two-year-old photos taken by researchers; average error was 29.1%, with volunteers especially inaccurate on the official identification matches. Mismatch average error was 10.6%. Australian has stated passport photo specifications comply fully with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards.\nAnother solution Dr David White mentioned is using multiple photographs: \"One of the more recent papers we've released shows that if you have multiple images \u2014 not just a single snapshot \u2014 there are quite large gains in performance\".\nAs coauthor Professor Mike Burton of the University of Aberdeen says: \"There is a great emphasis on a passport image to fit all purposes but people often comment on the fact that their passport photo looks nothing like them [...] It seems strange that we expect a single passport shot to encompass a person and allow us to consistently recognise them. Could there in fact be an argument for our passports to contain a multitude of images, taken at different angles, in different lighting and formats?\"\nThe research is supported by the Australian Passport Office within and also funded by the ."}

The party stated they informed Griffin of their decision yesterday and gave multiple reasons for the expulsion, including distributing inaccurate information, trying to damage the party's public image, harassment of staff members, and defying instructions given to him by current leader . Griffin has said he was \"'expelled' without trial\" and the BNP violated its constitution. \nGriffin was BNP chairman until July, when he quit the role and became honorary president; acting chairman Adam Walker took his place. Griffin was elected MEP (Member of the European Parliament) in 2009 but lost the seat in the 2014 election.\nUnder Griffin's tenure, the party reportedly experienced an increase in success, gaining more than 50 councillors in the UK and two MEPs in 2009, Griffin being one and the other Andrew Brons. However, more recently the party has reportedly had monetary difficulties and internal disputes, as well as disagreements over what attitudes the party should adopt.

Also, in January Nick Griffin was declared bankrupt.\n\"This has been a difficult decision to make and not one taken lightly\", a member of a conduct committee within the BNP commented. \"Although we all appreciate that Nick has achieved a lot for our Party in the past, we must also remember that the Party is bigger than any individual. Nick did not adjust well to being given the honourary title of President and it soon became obvious that he was unable to work as an equal member of the team and alarmingly his behaviour became more erratic and disruptive.\"\nThe conduct committee said they made their decision because of Griffin's behaviour, which included \"preparing a \u2018report\u2019 which tells lies about key Party personnel and finances and approving the leak of these damaging and defamatory allegations onto the internet\", \"harassing members of BNP staff and in at least one case making physical threats\", \"bringing the Party into disrepute through public statements\", \"publishing, causing to be published or being reckless as to the publication of untrue allegations against the Party in the form of e-mails giving a false account of [his] bankruptcy situation\" and \"disobeying legitimate, constitutional instructions given to [him] by our Chairman, Adam Walker aimed at preventing damage to the reputation and unity of the Party.\"\nGriffin's response to this expulsion from the party was to tweet: \"Breaking news! I've just been 'expelled' without trial from the #BNP! That'll teach me to tell a member of staff he's a 'useless, lazy twat'\". In a later tweet, he added: \"Only thing is that the ruling Wigton Soviet are operating outside the constitution so I shall ignore their plastic gangster games.\""}

The study was published in journal ' on Wednesday.\nThe researchers found that, depending on the availability of resources at the location of the colony and the size of the colony, the spider colonies have a different composition, promoting colony survival. The collective colony trait the scientists analyzed is the shifting ratio of \"aggressive\" and \"docile\" female spiders.

Sources in the Fatah movement blamed Hamas, the ruling movement in Gaza, for the attacks. Hamas has denied involvement and condemned the attacks.\nThe memorial was to take place on Tuesday at Al-Katiba square, to commemorate ten years since the founder and leader of the Fatah movement, Yasser Arafat, died. However according to , senior Gaza Strip Fatah leader, Gaza security services ordered the stage workers for the event \"to stop working and leave\".\nAgha said, \"After the series of explosions and assaults against Fatah leaders, we have been notified by Hamas' political and security officials that security services won't be able to take charge of security arrangements during the Arafat anniversary ceremony\".\nSome Fatah officials blamed the wave of explosions on Hamas. A Fatah spokesperson added they had been expecting the unity government \"to cater to the interests of our nation\". Hamas denied any connection to the events, and its spokesperson condemned the attacks on his Facebook page.\nHamas Ministry of Interior spokesperson Iyad Al-Buzm said the memorial had been cancelled due to the tense atmosphere between the two movements following the attacks during the last few days, and due to technical reasons, including the delay in salary payments to security personnel by the unity government. Furthermore, he said the prime minister of the unity government, , hadn't contacted security in the Gaza Strip.\nIn June 2014, after an agreement between Hamas and Fatah, a reconciliation government was established. This reconciliation was to have enabled the first memorial ceremony for Arafat in Gaza since Hamas took over the strip in 2007. For the past few months, however, recriminations between the two sides have marred the arrangement. About two months ago, Palestinian National Authority President Mahmoud Abbas accused Hamas of establishing a \"shadow government\" in the Gaza Strip. Hamas workers accuse Fatah-dominated leadership of not paying their salaries. "}

Their fate is unknown.\nSheriff Noel McPartlin called Mutch's conduct \"a determined course of action. Having regard to the gravity of the offence [of killing the goshawk], I am of the view that there is no other method of dealing with you which is appropriate to this case other than the imposition of a custodial sentence.\" Sara Shaw, Scotland's procurator fiscal (prosecutor) for wildlife crime, explained \"Goshawks in particular are rare birds: the court heard evidence in this case that there are only about 150 nesting pairs in Scotland.\" She said the law was there \"to preserve Scotland's natural heritage, including the wildlife that forms part of it.\"\nDavid McKie, defending, detailed other sanctions his client had already suffered.

Internationally, the species has a wide range and a large population through much of Europe, North America, Russia, and northern Asia. It is therefore ranked as least concern by the 's . However, the bird does face persecution and nest robbing by humans. Indirect human impacts include deforestation and, according to a 2012 study, developments.

Oborne says the failure of the \"Telegraph\" to cover HSBC is also present in the relative coverage given in November 2014 after the bank had to allocate a fund of 1 billion to compensate customers, as well as an investigation into manipulation of the currency market: Oborne argues these developments were given considerable coverage in competing newspapers including the ', ', and \"\" but the \"Telegraph\" covered them only briefly several pages into the business section.\nOborne's article alleges a number of other examples of suppression \u2014 calling the coverage of pro-democracy protests in \"bizarre\", and noting that the paper under-reported news of false accounting at but gave significant prominence to stories about the company without a critical edge.\nFollowing Oborne's article, a spokesman for the Telegraph responded: \"Like any other business, we never comment on individual commercial relationships, but our policy is absolutely clear. We aim to provide all our commercial partners with a range of advertising solutions, but the distinction between advertising and our award-winning editorial operation has always been fundamental to our business. We utterly refute any allegation to the contrary. It is a matter of huge regret that Peter Oborne, for nearly five years a contributor to the Telegraph, should have launched such an astonishing and unfounded attack, full of inaccuracy and innuendo, on his own paper.\"\nMedia commentator , writing for the \"Guardian\", described Oborne's allegations against the \"Telegraph\" as \"dynamite\" and said they go \"to the heart of a paper's credibility\". The , owners of the \"Telegraph\", \"are being held to account\", according to Greenslade, and Oborne \"has shone a light on a dark reality\"."}

So while we have taken steps in this to strengthen the ability to do that through the FOI act, if there needs to be more done to make that clear, then the prime minister is clear those steps should happen in the next parliament.\"\nThe legislation was already amended in 2010 to make it so that correspondence and other matters related to the Royal family are exempt from further freedom of information requests. Graham Smith, from , which campaigns for an elected head of state, argues there needs to be greater transparency over the Royal Family's affairs: \"The court has defended democratic principles over the interests of the royal family and that needs to be enshrined in law. David Cameron\u2019s response is worrying because he says he wants to tighten up the veto.\"\nThe Labour MP raised the possibility the ruling might have consequences for Charles' suitability to be King: \"If there are serious questions about the suitability of Prince Charles as a monarch there could be a question in the public mind about whether to skip a generation.

Defense secretary said Ed Miliband would end up signing up for \"a grubby backstairs deal\" with the (SNP) which would lead to the cancellation or non-renewal of the nuclear submarine programme. The Labour Party have stated they support the continuation of Trident and will not negotiate on Trident with the SNP.\nFallon's comments on Trident were backed up by David Cameron.\nThe Labour Party counter-claimed a deal between the Conservatives and had put the cost of Trident renewal up by 1.4bn.\nMiliband responded to Fallon's comments: \"Michael Fallon is a decent man, but today I think he has demeaned himself and he has demeaned his office. National security is too important to play politics with and I will never compromise national security.\"\nFormer Labour leader said Fallon's remarks hinted at desperation: \"The Tories were up to their old tricks in their personal attack on Ed this morning. I remember the of 1997. It is always a sign of desperation and it will backfire. It shows how nervous they are of a Labour campaign full of confidence, which is showing that it understands the challenges facing working people and how to overcome them. The more they indulge in these tactics the better we should feel.\"\nLiberal Democrat expressed his displeasure at Fallon's remarks, saying it was \"an appalling way to conduct the argument\".\nThe two main parties have also proposed a number of new ideas for policy. Labour's is to formally announce a new policy today to protect 10,000 police officers' jobs by eliminating elected and gun licensing subsidy, and sharing of police back-office services and procurement. The Labour crime and justice manifesto also includes creating a new commission on sexual and domestic violence, banning \"\", and reforming prisons to introduce more education and work for prisoners.\nConservative Cameron pre-announced a proposal to change the rules so workers in the public sector and for companies with 250 employees or more \u2014 which between the two is estimated to be around half the work force \u2014 would be entitled to three days of paid volunteering leave per year. In prepared remarks, Cameron is to call the move represents the \"clearest demonstration of the in action\". This marks a return of the language of the 'Big Society' which had slowly disappeared from use since the last election."}

Governor Pence declared the outbreak a public health emergency on March 26, and at the same time approved a 30-day needle exchange program. Pence since offered a 30-day extension as the number of HIV positive cases continued to rise.\nNeedle exchange programs provide clean needles in exchange for dirty needles. The sharing of dirty needles has been linked to the outbreak. Experts like Chris Beyrer, president of the , support needle exchange programs. Beyrer told the , however, that temporary measures, like the one Pence implemented on March 26, don't solve the long-term problem. The and the also recommend needle exchange programs. But experts say long-term needle exchange programs are needed.\nThe HIV epidemic in Southern Indiana has been linked to a drug problem in Scott County. HIV and Hepatitis C are blood-borne viruses that spread by way of bodily fluids and bloodstream injections, especially when more than one person is using the same needle. \nLegislators on the committee responsible for Senate Bill 461 heard testimony last week before voting. Representative , , , told Wikinews on April 27 that he was involved in conversations pertaining to needle exchange programs. \"I am inclined to follow the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control in implementing needle exchanges,\" Washburne said in an interview with Wikinews. \"My vote against Senate Bill 461 was not due to the needle exchanges, but other issues involved in the bill.\"\nHouse members passed the bill 80\u201319, senators 38\u201311. \nAfter legislators passed the bill, Pence told : \"From my perspective, the focus needs to be on health emergencies. I have throughout my career not supported needle exchanges as anti-drug policies. But with regard to addressing an epidemic, which is what we\u2019ve seen in Scott County, which is unprecedented in any rural part of the country. I was prepared to support that through executive action.\" \n, , about 35 miles south of Austin, was the first Kentucky municipal government to approve a needle exchange program. The Louisvile Metro Council voted 22\u20130 to approve the program on April 23. That approval requires reconsulting the council before actually implementing such a program. About 195 cities in the have adopted similar programs.\nDr. William Shaffner, a doctor and chair of the Department of Preventative Medicine at in , , told Wikinews reporters March 25 at the in Evansville, the day before Pence declared the public health emergency, such a program would make sense. He said the best course of action would be to \"block and tackle.\" \n\"Needle exchange programs ought to be used,\" Shaffner said. \"They have been proven to work and do not cause an increase in drug use.\" "}

The government's Flag Consideration Project has planned a number of conferences and roadshows as part of this process, with the first meeting set to take place in on May 16. According to the New Zealand Herald, Emeritus Professor John Burrows, the chairman of the project's panel of twelve, said New Zealand's flag has never before been open to public choice.\nProfessor Burrows also said resources and kits would be accessible for schools and communities, \"For example, schools can run their own flag discussions and referendums to mirror the formal process as part of their own learning exercise\".

Mr Doyle said Mr Causevic and Mr Besim had planned to carry out a terror attack in Melbourne if they weren't able to access passports to head overseas. \nDenis Scott, an agent, told the court how Mr Causevic had allegedly called AFP and the officers \"dogs\" during the process of trying to obtain a passport in March. \nIt was also revealed that Mr Besim had been speaking to a 14-year-old boy in the over the Internet.

Although the party led a Coalition government it formed alongside the Liberal Democrats after the previous general election in 2010, this is the first time the party has won an overall majority since 1992. \nAcross the UK, Conservatives won 331 seats out of the 650 available, an increase of 24 on their 2010 total.

Statistics reported by the BBC suggest the voting turnout was 66.1%, based on an electorate of approximately 46.4 million.\nThe bulk of Conservative seat increases occurred in England, where their seat total increased by 21 to 319 out of a possible 533. Labour's seat count here increased by 15 to 206, while the Liberal Democrats dropped from 43 seats to six. The final results defied opinion polls, which had broadly suggested Labour and Conservatives were tied for the lead. An independent inquiry is set to be conducted into opinion polling accuracy in the UK, given they had appeared to underestimate the Conservatives' success and/or overestimate Labour's results.\n\"I truly believe we are on the brink of something special in our country\", David Cameron said in a speech yesterday. \"We can make Britain a place where a good life is in reach for everyone who is willing to work and do the right thing.

For the latter, he said, \"our plans are to create the strongest devolved government anywhere in the world with important powers over taxation.\"\nIn Scotland, the Scottish National Party (SNP) made the largest gains of any party in the UK, increasing from six seats to 56 seats out of a possible 59, the highest number they have ever had, based on a Scotland vote share of approximately 50%. The number of constituencies held by Labour and Liberal Democrats there decreased from 41 and 11, respectively, to one for each of them, with the Conservatives staying at one seat. SNP leader , who said this result had surpassed her expectations, said \"the tectonic plates of Scottish politics [have] shifted\". Sturgeon also stated that the SNP would \"work with others across the UK, to try to get more progressive politics at the heart of Westminster\". One seat, , experienced a record swing of 39% from Labour to the SNP.

Murphy also said he will not stand for the Scottish Parliament and will \"do something else\". \nAt a meeting in the Scottish city Glasgow yesterday, the party's national executive held a vote of no confidence in Murphy; he won by 17 votes to 14. \"Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago\", Murphy said. Murphy became Scottish Labour leader in December 2014, following 's resignation from the role. Until Scottish Labour holds a fresh leadership election \u2014 its sixth in a span of eight years \u2014 , currently the party's deputy leader, is to assume the role of acting leader for the time being. Murphy cited concerns about Scottish Labour being divided as a contributory factor to his decision. \"Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party\", he said yesterday. \"We have been the greatest force for change in our nation\u2019s remarkable history. The Scottish Labour party will rise again.

Labour Party supporters were reportedly asked to sign a letter supporting Murphy's leadership, to be presented at the executive meeting yesterday. Calls for Murphy to resign came from multiple quarters, including trade unions and , as well as Labour MSPs and . Earlier in the week, Unite general secretary said \"the anti-Scottish card that was played by and the Conservatives\" had caused them to win a majority in the general election, before going on to say: \"I lay the blame for that very squarely at the feet of Scottish Labour.

Murphy singled out McCluskey for criticism, claiming to have \"been at the centre of a campaign by the London leadership of the Unite union in blaming myself and the Scottish Labour party for the defeat of the UK Labour party in the general election. That is a grotesque insult to the Scottish Labour party.\" He went on to criticise what he called McCluskey's \"destructive behaviour\", commenting that: \"Whether in Scotland, or in the contest to come across the UK, we cannot have our leaders selected or deselected by the grudges and grievances of one prominent man. The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn\u2019t serve at the grace of Len McCluskey and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.\"\nReacting to the news, SNP leader and Scottish Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: \"I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future.

Investigating into how the policy is affecting the Edinburgh music scene, a group of Wikinews writers interviewed venue owners, academics, the , and local band The Mean Reds to get different perspectives on the issue. \nSince the clause was introduced by the government of the city of Edinburgh, licensed venues have been prohibited from allowing music to be amplified to the extent it is audible to nearby residential properties. This has affected the live music scene, with several venues discontinuing regular events such as open mic nights, and hosting bands and artists.\nCurrently, the licensing policy allows licensing standards officers to order a venue to cease live music on any particular night, based on a single noise complaint from the public. The volume is not electronically measured to determine if it breaches a volume level. Over roughly the past year there have been 56 separate noise complaints made against 18 venues throughout the city.\nA petition to amend the clause has garnered over 3,000 signatures, including the support of bar owners, musicians, and members of the general public. \nOn November 17, 2014, the government's Culture and Sport Committee hosted an open forum meeting at . Musicians, venue owners and industry professionals were encouraged to provide their thoughts on how the council could improve live music in the city. Ways to promote live music as a key cultural aspect of Edinburgh were discussed and it was suggested that it could be beneficial to try and replicate the management system of live music of other global cities renowned for their live music scenes. However, the suggestion which prevailed above all others was simply to review the existing licensing policy.\nCouncillor (Cllr) Norma Austin-Hart, Vice Convenor of the Culture and Sport Committee, is responsible for the working group Music is Audible. The group is comprised of local music professionals, and councillors and officials from Edinburgh Council. A document circulated to the Music is Audible group stated the council aims \"to achieve a balance between protecting residents and supporting venues\".\nFollowing standard procedure, when a complaint is made, a Licensing Standards Officer (LSO) is dispatched to investigate the venue and evaluate the level of noise. If deemed to be too loud, the LSO asks the venue to lower the noise level. According to a document provided by the City of Edinburgh Council, \"not one single business has lost its license or been closed down because of a breach to the noise condition in Edinburgh.\"\nIn the Scotland Licensing Policy (2005), Clause 6.2 states, \"where the operating plan indicates that music is to be played in a premises, the board will consider the imposition of a condition requiring amplified music from those premises to be inaudible in residential property.\" According to Cllr Austin-Hart, the high volume of tenement housing in the city centre makes it difficult for music to be inaudible.\nDuring the during the summer, venues are given temporary licences that allow them to operate for the duration of the festival and under the condition that \"all amplified music and vocals are controlled to the satisfaction of the Director of Services for Communities\", as stated in a document from the council. During the festival, there is an 11 p.m. noise restriction on amplified music, and noise may be measured by Environmental Health staff using sophisticated equipment. Noise is restricted to 65dB(A) from the facades of residential properties; however, complaints from residents still occur. In the document from the council, they note these conditions and limitations for temporary venues would not necessarily be appropriate for permanent licensed premises.\nIn a phone interview, Cllr Austin-Hart expressed her concern about the unsettlement in Edinburgh regarding live music. She referenced the closure of the well-known Picture House, a venue that has provided entertainment for over half a century, and the community's opposition to commercial public bar chain Wetherspoon buying the venue. \"[It] is a well-known pub that does not play any form of music\", Cllr Austin-Hart said. \"[T]hey feel as if it is another blow to Edinburgh's live music\". \"[We] cannot stop Wetherspoon's from buying this venue; we have no control over this.\"\nThe venue has operated under different names, including the Caley Palais which hosted bands such as Queen and AC/DC. The Picture House opened in 2008.\nOne of the venues which has been significantly affected by the licensing laws is the Phoenix Bar, on Broughton Street. The bar's owner, Sam Roberts, was induced to cease live music gigs in March, following a number of noise complaints against the venue. As a result, Ms Roberts was inspired to start the aforementioned petition to have Clause 6.2 of the licensing policy reviewed, in an effort to remove the 'inaudibility' statement that is affecting venues and the music scene.\n\"I think we not only encourage it, but actively support the Edinburgh music scene,\" Ms Roberts says of the Phoenix Bar and other venues, \"the problem is that it is a dying scene.\"\nWhen Ms Roberts purchased the venue in 2013, she continued the existing 30-year legacy established by the previous owners of hosting live acts. Representative of Edinburgh's colourful music scene, a diverse range of genres have been hosted at the venue. Ms Roberts described the atmosphere when live music acts perform at her venue as \"electric\". \"The whole community comes together singing, dancing and having a party. Letting their hair down and forgetting their troubles. People go home happy after a brilliant night out. All the staff usually join in; the pub comes alive\". However licensing restrictions have seen a majority of the acts shut down due to noise complaints. \"We have put on jazz, blues, rock, rockabilly, folk, celtic and pop live acts and have had to close everything down.\" \"Residents in Edinburgh unfortunately know that the Council policy gives them all the rights in the world, and the pubs and clubs none\", Ms Roberts clarified.\nDiscussing how inaudibility has affected venues and musicians alike, Ms Roberts stated many pubs have lost profit through the absence of gigs, and trying to soundproof their venue. \"It has put many musicians out of work and it has had an enormous effect on earnings in the pub. [...] Many clubs and bars have been forced to invest in thousands of worth of soundproofing equipment which has nearly bankrupted them, only to find that even the tiniest bit of noise can still force a closure. It is a ridiculously one-sided situation.\" \nMs Roberts feels inaudibility is an unfair clause for venues. \"I think it very clearly favours residents in Edinburgh and not business. [...] \"Nothing\" is being done to support local business, and closing down all the live music venues in Edinburgh has hurt financially in so many ways. Not only do you lose money, you lose new faces, you lose the respect of the local musicians, and you begin to lose all hope in a 'fair go'.\"\nWith the petition holding a considerable number of signatures, Ms Roberts states she is still sceptical of any change occurring. \"Over three thousand people have signed the petition and still the council is not moving. They have taken action on petitions with far fewer signatures.\" Ms Roberts also added, \"Right now I don't think Edinburgh has much hope of positive change\".\nMs Roberts seems to have lost all hope for positive change in relation to Edinburgh's music scene, and argues Glasgow is now the regional choice for live music and venues. \"[E]veryone in the business knows they have to go to Glasgow for a decent scene. Glasgow City Council get behind their city.\"\nMs Martina Cannon, member of local band The Mean Reds, said a regular 'Open Mic Night' she hosted at The Parlour on Duke Street has ceased after a number of complaints were made against the venue. \"It was a shame because it had built up some momentum over the months it had been running\". She described financial loss to the venue from cancelling the event, as well as loss to her as organiser of the event.\nSneaky Pete's music bar and club, owned by Nick Stewart, is described on its website as \"open and busy every night\".\n\"Many clubs could be defined as bars that host music, but we really are a music venue that serves drinks\", Mr Stewart says. He sees the live music scene as essential for maintaining nightlife in Edinburgh not only because of the economic benefit but more importantly because of the cultural significance. \n\"Music is one of the important things in life. [...] it's emotionally and intellectually engaging, and it adds to the quality of life that people lead.\"\nSneaky Pete's has not been immune to the inaudibility clause. The business has spent about 20,000 pounds on multiple soundproofing fixes designed to quell complaints from neighboring residents. \"The business suffered a great deal in between losing the option to do gigs for fear of complaints, and finishing the soundproofing. As I mentioned, we are a music business that serves drinks, not a bar that also has music, so when we lose shows, we lose a great deal of trade\", said Mr Stewart.\nHe believes there is a better way to go about handling complaints and fixing public nuisances. \"The local mandatory condition requiring 'amplified music and vocals' to be 'inaudible' should be struck from all licenses. The requirement presupposes that nuisance is caused by music venues, when this may not reasonably be said to be the case. [...] Nuisance is not defined in the Licensing Act nor is it defined in the Public Health Act (Scotland) 2008. However, The Consultation on Guidance to accompany the Statutory Nuisance Provisions of the Public Health etc (Scotland) Act 2008 states that 'There are eight key issues to consider when evaluating whether a nuisance exists[...]'\".\nThe eight key factors are impact, locality, time, frequency, duration, convention, importance, and avoidability. Stewart believes it is these factors that should be taken into consideration by LSOs responding to complaints instead of the sole factor of \"audibility\".\nHe believes multiple steps should be taken before considering revocation of licenses. Firstly, LSOs should determine whether a venue is a nuisance based on the eight factors. Then, the venue should have the opportunity to comply by using methods such as changing the nature of their live performances (e.g. from hard rock to acoustic rock), changing their hours of operation, or soundproofing. If the venue still fails to comply, then a board can review their license with the goal of finding more ways to bring them into compliance as opposed to revoking their license.\nNick Stewart has discussed his proposal at length with Music is Audible and said he means to present his proposal to the City of Edinburgh Council.\nDr Adam Behr, a music academic and research associate at the who has conducted research on the cultural value of live music, says live music significantly contributes to the economic performance of cities. He said studies have shown revenue creation and the provision of employment are significant factors which come about as a result of live music. A 2014 report by UK Music showed the economic value generated by live music in the UK in 2013 was 789 million and provided the equivalent of 21,600 full time jobs.\nAs the music industry is international by nature, Behr says this complicates the way revenue is allocated, \"For instance, if an American artist plays a venue owned by a British company at a gig which is promoted by a company that is part British owned but majority owned by, say, Live Nation (a major international entertainment company) \u2014 then the flow of revenues might not be as straightforward as it seems [at] first.\"\nDespite these complexities, Behr highlighted the broader advantages, \"There are, of course, ancillary benefits, especially for big gigs [...] Obviously other local businesses like bars, restaurants and carparks benefit from increased trade\", he added.\nBehr criticised the idea of making music inaudible and called it \"unrealistic\". He said it could limit what kind of music can be played at venues and could force vendors to spend a large amount of money on equipment that enables them to meet noise cancelling requirements. He also mentioned the consequences this has for grassroots music venues as more 'established' venues within the city would be the only ones able to afford these changes.\nAlongside the inaudibility dispute has been the number of sites that have been closing for the past number of years. According to Dr Behr, this has brought attention to the issue of retaining live music venues in the city and has caused the council to re-evaluate its music strategy and overall cultural policy.\nThis month, Dr Behr said he is to work on a live music census for Edinburgh's Council which aims to find out what types of music is played, where, and what exactly it brings to the city. This is in an effort to get the Edinburgh city council to see any opportunities it has with live music and the importance of grassroots venues. The census is similar to one conducted in Victoria, Australia in 2012 on the extent of live music in the state and its economic benefit.\nAs for the solution to the inaudibility clause, Behr says the initial step is dialogue, and this has already begun. \"Having forum discussion, though, is a start \u2014 and an improvement\", he said. \"There won't be an overnight solution, but work is ongoing to try to find one that can stick in the long term.\"\nBeverley Whitrick, Strategic Director of Music Venue Trust, said she is unable to comment on her work with the City of Edinburgh Council or on potential changes to the inaudibility clause in the Licensing Policy. However, she says, \"I have been asked to assess the situation and make recommendations in September\".\nAccording to , the Council is working toward helping Edinburgh's cultural and entertainment scene. Deputy Council Leader Sandy Howat said views of the entertainment industry needs to change and the Council will no longer consider the scene as a \"sideline\".\nSenior members of the Council, The Scotsman reported, aim to review the planning of the city to make culture more of a priority. Howat said, \"If you're trying to harness a living community and are creating facilities for people living, working and playing then culture should form part of that.\"\nThe review of the inaudibility clause in the Licensing Policy is set to be reviewed near the end of 2016 but the concept of bringing it forward to this year is still under discussion."}

Burmese nationals Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo, both 22, are currently on trial accused of murdering David Miller, 24, from Jersey, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, from England. With the defence case due to begin shortly and continue until mid- or late September the court has issued its judgement today following a hearing on Friday.\nThe case dates to September last year when the victims were found murdered on a beach. Witheridge had been raped. The case attracted worldwide attention with Lin and Phyo confessing, before re-enacting the killing in front of the press.\nThe accused claim the confessions were tortured out of them and the ongoing trial is unfair. UK Prime Minister David Cameron intervened, speaking to Thai Prime Minister . Cameron and Chan-o-cha arranged for an observer team from the Metropolitan Police to conduct an inspection of the Thai probe, based on powers in the .\nA team was duly dispatched and prepared a report with the intent to use it for assisting the victims' families. UK police were expressly forbidden, at a ministerial level, to provide any assistance to Thai authorities as the case involves the death penalty.

It is this report that Lin and Phyo were seeking.\nUsing the the defendants asked police for this report to assist their defence, and were denied.

Mr Justice Green read the report himself and decided not to release it as it was of no assistance to the pair.\nThe report is known to contain some material disputed by Lin and Phyo. It says they repeated their confessions at various times, including in court with legal representation, before retracting them. It also says they have not backed up their torture claims with evidence, medical or otherwise.\nMr Justice Green said the report described \"in many respects [...] no more than the routine conduct of a serious crime investigation. This is not a Report which contains, for instance, state secrets.\" He also spoke of his distance from the ongoing trial, prompting him to remark of his \"very considerable unease\" and having to do \"the best I could\" \u2014 not \"a comfortable process\".\nNoting \"the issues of both law and fact are complex, novel and difficult\" Mr Justice Green's judgement notes that, before even hearing the case he promised permission to appeal would be granted, if requested, whatever the outcome. He also promised a swift Court of Appeal hearing to comply with Thai trial time constraints. \"The stakes are very high for both sides\", he added.\n\"In my judgment the ,\" the judgement reads, \"and in particular the principles of natural justice and fairness, would in a case such as this which involves the right to life, and the right to a fair trial, as well as powerful countervailing issues of public interest, compel the court to apply the most intense level of anxious scrutiny to the facts to ensure that the accused were not prejudiced.\"\nMr Justice Green also ruled the pair, in principal, \"have a perfectly proper right to seek access to the personal data for the purpose of using it subsequently in their defence in criminal proceedings\", calling the case one about \"fundamental rights\".\nRosa Curling, who represented both men in the London court, has said they would not appeal. She said Lin and Phyo are \"disappointed\" but \"are reassured that at least a British judge has now looked at the information held by the Metropolitan Police, applying anxious scrutiny, and determined that it would not assist them in their ongoing proceedings in Thailand.\"\n\"Wikinews\" has contacted the Metropolitan Police, usually responsible for policing London, for a statement and is awaiting a response."}

The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft found evidence of the liquid on the Martian surface, in long dark spots on the Red Planet thought to be formed because of water flow. \nIn a news conference, NASA's director, said, \"We now know Mars was once a planet very much like Earth with warm salty seas and fresh water lakes [...] but something has happened to Mars, it lost its water.\"\nWater is thought to flow down slopes in the warm summer months and dry up as the temperature drops seasonally. Scientists have different theories about the water's origin, as perhaps from the Martian atmosphere or from ice below the surface.\nIn 2011, Lujendra Ojha proposed the theory of water on the Martian surface, after studying salt samples from Martian soil. The temperature of Mars is close to the freezing point of water, but the presence of salt lowers the freezing point. Alfred McEwen, professor of at the University of Arizona, described the water as \"briny\". Moreover, the (RSL) on the surface of Mars are found to slide down the slope in the hotter season indicating the presence of water.\nNASA's associate administrator John Grunsfeld said those observations gave a better picture about the planet's resources that could be helpful in the future. Grunsfeld tweeted \"Water on Mars, not just frozen. Is anything drinking it? Someday we wil find out on our #JourneyToMars\".\nTo mark this discovery, Google created a in which Mars is sipping water."}

By various reports seven or nine people were also injured. Officials said Mercer killed himself during the subsequent shootout with police.\nMercer began the killing spree in a class where he was a student by shooting the class teacher, and killed eight students in that and at least one other classroom. In the next classroom, a student nurse unsuccessfully tried to save the life of her friend who was wounded by the gunman. Another student, ex-soldier Chris Mintz, was shot seven times after coming to help.\nThe reasons for the attack are not known but reports he singled out people who identified themselves as . The noted Mercer may have revealed his plans via social media and possibly left a written statement. He briefly served in the in 2008.\nAn ATF () agent said authorities found six weapons at the college and a further seven weapons from the gunman's home, including a shotgun, all of which appear to have been obtained lawfully by Mercer and members of his family. State laws permit people to carry concealed weapons in higher education institutions and at least one other person at the college was armed. Oregon recently passed a new gun law in response to a shooting incident in 2012, in which a man used a stolen rifle to murder two other people in a shopping center.\nLater on Thursday, President Barack Obama spoke for twelve minutes about the incident and called for stricter gun controls in line with other countries like Australia and the United Kingdom. Referring to earlier similar shootings, he said \"Somehow this has become routine. The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine, the conversation in the aftermath of it. We have become numb to this\". This is reportedly the fifteenth occasion Obama has spoken out after such a killing spree. He expressed his belief that there would soon be a \"press release\" from the pro-gun lobby, who would call for a reduction of gun controls. He also predicted there would be criticism levelled at him about his politicization of the matter, but he said \"this is something we should politicize.\" Although no new initiative was outlined, Obama highlighted opposition which had stopped \"the collection of data on shooting incidents\" and stated \"this is not something I can do myself.\""}

Pricasso has been painting portraits using his penis for more than ten years.\nBased in Australia, Pricasso paints his artwork using his and in addition to his penis.

Pricasso also practices other styles besides portraits, including and . Typically his portraits take him not more than 15 minutes to paint. He told Coconuts TV he chose to specialize in creating artwork in this manner because he felt it was a . \nHis fanbase is international; Pricasso has journeyed to locations including the United States, Holland, Germany, Brazil, Mexico and China to paint portraits for people. Though he is willing to travel to display his talent, Pricasso told \"\" most of his income is Internet-based.\n\"Wikinews\" interviewed Pricasso about his artwork and asked for his thoughts on topics of censorship and freedom of expression. We discussed what are considered appropriate forms of and of \u2014 protected in the United States following the Supreme Court case \"Hustler Magazine v. Falwell\".\nThe interview touched upon a 2013 conflict which arose on our sister site for images and media, , when an image of a portrait of Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales painted by Pricasso was uploaded to the site. Wales called it \"harassment\" and a succession of deletion discussions ensued. We asked Pricasso about this as well as the different reaction from former-Mayor of Cape Town Helen Zille, who called his painting of her part of a \"free society\" where artists \"exercise their freedom in unusual ways.\"\nInterview.\n Pricasso, thanks for agreeing to do this interview with Wikinews.\nPricasso: Thanks for doing this, great questions.\n How long have you been painting in this particular fashion?\nPricasso: I first tried it over 10 years ago and realised it would be possible with practice to get as good with it but in a slightly more impressionistic style than I could with a brush, and I really liked the results, of course at first I had to work out the paint formula and what to paint on which was done by trial and error \u2014 and then finding somewhere to practice, which was a problem until I was invited to become a member of a Bondage club in Brisbane, my first patron. There I realised that there were so many people with totally different views on what is acceptable in society, and were always protesting over most censorship issues.\n How long can you paint with your penis at one time before it gets too tiring?\nPricasso: At most Sexpo's and Adult Expos I paint for 13 hours a day in half slots so I paint 20 plus paintings a day. When I am painting I have to concentrate hard and go into a meditative state; I don't notice much going on around me until I have finished.\n Other than your penis, what other parts of your body do you use in the painting process?\nPricasso: I quickly worked out that I could speed it up by using my testicles and butt cheeks to cover large areas in no time at all, but only recently do I paint the edges using my butt-crack, I call it the credit card swipe!\n How did you come up with the name Pricasso?\nPricasso: That was the heading they christened me with in the Picture Magazine interview in 2006. I realised it was Gold and took out the website and trademark.\n What's the most positive reaction you've had to one of your paintings?\nPricasso: It is always satisfying to get applause when a painting is finished; at most adult shows this happened all the time; but I do like painting disabled people. I have painted several people with severe and they are over the moon with the result; this gives me the most pleasure, as I do realise that they are still sexually active people and everyone should realise this.\n Have any of your paintings been featured in a gallery somewhere?\nPricasso: I have entered the Exhibition in Australia every year and sold a few. Also at an exhibition of politicians in Australia, and last November I went to Miami for the \"Art undressed\" exhibition and also painted 15 minute portraits there which was fun.\n Do you consider it a form of freedom of expression to create your artwork in the way you do with your penis?\nPricasso: When I first thought of the idea I was really thinking I could get invited to a few parties as the entertainment which I do regularly, but now I am getting a good style about my work and want to take it to the next level and be accepted as an innovator.\n In 2008, prior to a Sexpo event in South Africa, you uploaded a video to the Internet of yourself painting a portrait of then-Mayor of Cape Town Helen Zille. Why did you decide to do this?\nPricasso: No particular reason on my behalf, it was the organisers of the Sexpo who got me to paint it mainly for publicity. But also to have a portrait on my stand, who people in Cape Town would relate to as I now know she is very popular and has a great sense of humour.\n Mayor of Cape Town Helen Zille commented of your portrait painting of her: \"This is a free country. A free society throws up these kinds of people, who exercise their freedom in unusual ways. And if this is how he wants to do it, I must accept his constitutional right to do so.\" \u2014 what are your thoughts on her reaction?\nPricasso: Sounds a bit formal but that is how politicians usually talk, guarded and a totally correct response, the trouble is that if they spoke from the heart it might come back to bite them one day, but I did talk to one of her aides privately and she said they were all really impressed and loved the concept, I really should have offered to paint her too but I was probably flat out all day \u2014 I always am at the South African shows.\n Mayor Zille further commented about the quality of your painting of her: \"[Pricasso] has achieved a good likeness and I can't imagine how he painted it without brushes or conventional equipment.\" \u2014 what do you think of this assessment?\nPricasso: Most people are impressed when they see it done, skeptical at first but after the initial shock they all usually stop to watch until I finish that particular painting, usually they take about 15 minutes.\n If you could speak to Mayor Zille, what would you say to her about her reaction to your painting of her?\nPricasso: I would say I was impressed with her response, mostly girls are much more impressed than guys only a minority of guys I might add, lots of them love it and me too!! But in general she gave a responsible and educated reply and was not at all offended by the experience.\n In 2011, one member of the Sculptors' Society quit in protest due to your participation in the 'Exotic Erotic' show \u2014 how do you feel when people react to your artwork in this way?\nPricasso: I guess I could say; This is a free country. A free society throws up these kinds of people, who exercise their dissaproval in various ways. And if this is how she wants to protest, I must accept her constitutional right to do so. There was that politically correct enough? Or maybe the silly old B***ch \u2014 but her reaction did get heaps of publicity for the show and they had record numbers coming through the doors so there was a silver lining.\nBut obviously it is a bit confronting and not everyone's cup of tea but if they could just see it before they get on their high horse they might have a different point of view.\n You painted a portrait of Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales in 2013; a picture and a video file of the making of this painting were uploaded to Wikipedia's sister site for images and media, Wikimedia Commons. Shortly thereafter, the files were \u2014 what are your thoughts on this discussion?\nPricasso: I did not think Wikipedia censored anything as on Jimmy Wales' Twitter account his banner heading is: \"Wikia guy. Free speech activist, entrepreneur.\" Either this is misleading in the very least or blatantly untrue. \n The deletion discussion at Wikimedia Commons resulted in keeping the photograph of your portrait of Jimmy Wales, but deleting the video of your making-of-the-portrait \u2014 do you consider a video of your portrait painting to be offensive?\nPricasso: Not in the least; it's pure .\n During the deletion discussion, Jimmy Wales commented ' What do you think of his response to your artwork? Do you feel your paintings constitute harassment?\nPricasso: Harassment is when one continually annoys someone, over and over again; I only painted the one painting of him and it to my mind was not offensive, I consider my work as just like late night TV, something that gives light relief to a serious subject. There are many examples of images on Wikipedia, so why are they still up there or is it just the things Jimmy Wales doesn't like get taken down? By the way anyone who has not seen the offending Video can view it on under Pricasso: http://vimeo.com/user10315938/review/68837137/893b31ca54\nI paint about 1000 portraits a year and get paid by the sitters or a close friend of them to do so. I had a request to paint a portrait, to do [this] portrait of Jimmy Wales with a video of me painting, by (who is an editor at Wikipedia), something I do all the time and I have great feedback as to how funny the videos are; I had no idea who Jimmy Wales was at the time of the request, but painted him only once so it can't be called Harassment. Is he just using his position of power to cut and ... It took me a lot of effort and time to put this together so I was pretty upset. And would really like it to be republished next to the portrait as originally it was before Mr Wales had it removed.\n How do you compare the reactions by Mayor of Cape Town Helen Zille who said your portrait painting of her was a product of a \"free society\" and a reflection of how people \"exercise their freedom\" with the comment by Jimmy Wales calling the publication of your artwork \"harassment\" ? Which of these individuals do you feel is correct, Mayor Zille or Wales, and why?\nPricasso: I think Helen got it. They in South Africa are struggling with change from being suppressed to one of freedom as she said \"a free society\". Jimmy Wales on the other hand although promoting himself as The Free Speech Guy is censoring things he does not agree with and calling it Harassment, not a good look Jimmy!!\nI did put the video of Helen Zille being painted on YouTube. It was there for a few months but they too delete my work quite regularly so it's probably long gone.\nShe is an experienced politician and would weigh up the fors and against before she acted, obviously the fors had it.\nMr. Wales on the other hand has probably not seen a lot of my work; if he had he would know I do it for fun and not really to be taken too seriously, it's a comedy performance, but he could not see the unique talent of someone who has cornered the world market of penis portraits painting with no imitators for the past 10 years, so before too many people could have a small chuckle at his expense he had it deleted, I'm sure there would be many others who would like to remove things on Wikipedia but don't have the muscle to do so.\n Have you experienced censorship or attempts by others to limit your freedom of expression? How so, and what was your reaction?\nPricasso: As I said before YouTube is always deleting my videos when someone complains, sometimes even when there is no genitals visible. Once one was taken down because the guy I was painting had the word (fuck) on his tee shirt; I mean how many films have this word in the dialogue. Also in Macau at the adult show, the people who make the rules make me perform inside an enclosed area, and people are wary of coming in through the door so is a bit slow there; and the guys that run the show are so polite and passionate trying to change China slowly, making it more open, that I keep on returning year after year.\n Do you consider some of your art pieces to be forms of or of famous people?\nPricasso: Oh yes I love creating something topical and painting a spoof on famous people, and painting with a penis really lends itself to this form of art, but I just painted a normal portrait of Jimmy Wales, as I said before I had no idea who he was before I googled him. And found this heading [on] his Twitter account (seems to me he has a few double standards) \"Jimmy Wales\u2028 Verified account\u2028\u202a @jimmy_wales You know, the \u202a@Wikipedia and \u202a@Wikia guy. Free speech activist, entrepreneur.\"\n Are you familiar with the U.S. Supreme Court case, \"Hustler Magazine v. Falwell\"\u00a0? How do you feel after reading about the unanimous decision protecting as a form of freedom of speech in that case?\nPricasso: Thanks for sharing that with me, I had no idea about this case and it's good to know that freedom of speech is alive and well in America. Actually I was a bit taken aback by the parody and slightly offended that I have been put in the same category, my painting is pure and I don't go out of my way to offend. And I am totally against censorship. It's a shame the same is not true about Wikipedia and Mr. Wales.\n Pricasso, thanks again for doing this interview with \"Wikinews\", is there anything else you'd like to add?\nPricasso: Not at the moment. I'm exhausted! Thanks."}
