The 45-year-old, from , England, had been accused of murdering her son Harry and daughter Elise, aged three and two years respectively.\nThe murders occurred in January 2010, with the bodies of Harry and Elise Donnison found in bags in their mother's car, close to the family's former residence in . Fiona Donnison is thought to have then awaited the arrival of Paul Donnison, her former partner, with two knives to injure him. Mr Donnison failed to appear at the scene; he was residing with a new girlfriend at the time.\nOn January 27 of this year, Fiona Donnison entered a police station in the town of and confessed to murdering the children but did not inform police of the location of their bodies. When the vehicle was searched, the bodies of Elise and Harry were discovered in two separate holdalls.\nIn , where the trial was held, the prosecution described Donnison suffocating the children to death and placing their bodies inside a vehicle. Donnison herself did not give evidence at trial.\nThe defence for Donnison claimed that she had been suffering from severe depression and was not in the correct state of mind at the time of the incident, saying that the offences should be downgraded to manslaughter. The defence claimed she was unable to recall the incident and was not able to bring herself to identify the two children by name.\nA clinical psychologist contested that statement, deeming such mental health difficulties impossible in this case. It was \"100% likely [she was] feigning\" them, they said. The prosecution attributed their claims to the preparation involved in the committing of the crime. This, it said, was justification for the murder charge.\nThe jury at Lewes Crown Court unanimously found Fiona Donnison guilty of the two murders. As the verdict was delivered, the accused opted to remain in her cell. She was sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum period in custody of 32 years. The judge, Mr Justice Nicol, believed that their deaths were \"no accident\". He remarked: \"You killed them, you who were their mother. Why you did this defies logical explanation. It seems it can only have something to do with your feelings for Paul Donnison, the children's father and your former partner.\"\nOutside the court, Paul Donnison commented that his family had suffered an \"almost unbearable\" experience. Paul also claimed that the system for bringing criminals to justice was \"biased\" towards the accused, commenting on how Fiona had been handled \"with kid gloves\".\nWith the sentence having been given out, it has emerged that prosecutors were intending to have Ms. Donnison tried for a third murder charge. This would have been for Mia, the first child Fiona had with Paul. Mia died at the age of nine months in April 2004, originally thought to be down to . In a hearing before the trial, the prosecuting side claimed they had \"taken together\" enough evidence for a murder charge to be taken in contemplation in Mia's case. Mr Justice Cooke decided against this charge being brought on as part of the court trial, citing the absence of direct evidence about the death of Mia."}

Tymoshenko faces trial in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, facing charges of abuse of office and exceeding her power as Prime Minister.\nProsecutors charged Tymoshenko in May 2011 for overstepping her powers by signing a gas deal with Russia in January 2009. Investigators believed the gas price agreement was too high and caused the Ukrainian economy to lose at least US$182 million. As a result of these initial charges she was placed under travel restrictions.\nAs the trial began, Tymoshenko was accused of repeatedly violating court rules and proceedings. The judge ordered her arrest for contempt after she reportedly refused to stand up whilst addressing the judge. The prosecution accused Tymoshenko of mocking witnesses openly questioning Judge Rodion Kireyev\u2019s objectivity. Tymoshenko denies these charges and believing the trial is merely political. Tymoshenko\u2019s lawyer Sergei Vlasenko describes her detention as \"unprecedented and illegal.\"\nMany have appealed for her release, including her lawyers, 200 prominent Ukrainians who signed a petition, leader of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church Patriarch Filaret, and Foreign Minister Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk. Both Tymoshenko and her supporters believe this trial is politically motivated with ties to President Viktor Yanukovych, suspected of attempting to bar her from future elections. The trial has attracted the attention of both the US and EU, who have criticised the charges, saying selective prosecution of political opponents is evident. However, the Ukrainian government denies any involvement.\nOutside the court, protestors have been occupying Kiev\u2019s main streets, setting up tents and waiving the white and red flags of Tymoshenko\u2019s political party. The support for her release is overwhelming, despite a ban on rallies passed by city court. Protestors are being watched closely by dozens of Berkut anti-riot police. If sentenced, Tymoshenko may face up to ten years in prison. The trial is expected to continue next Monday."}

On August 3, plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) reported potentially deadly levels of radiation in the damaged reactors, including one reading of 10 sieverts per hour. Such levels are enough to kill a person \u201cwithin a few weeks\u201d, according to the , and are 250 times the readings recorded immediately after the disaster.\nThe radiation findings have further called into question the response of government and industry to the crisis, with renewed allegations of incompetence and dishonesty being levelled against Japanese authorities over the transparency of information released in the months following the disaster. TEPCO only conceded that \u201cpartial meltdowns\u201d had occurred in up to three of the Fukushima site\u2019s reactors last month.\nIn testimony to Japanese parliament in late July, Professor Tatsuhiko Kodama, head of the Radioisotope Centre at the , condemned the government's response to the catastrophe. His criticism centered on inadequate radiation measurement methods and the failure to properly protect communities potentially affected by radioactivity from the stricken plant, citing the example of school bus routes passing through areas, such as Iitate-Mura, with unsafe levels of radiation.\nKodama says the \u201c equivalent\u201d of the radiation from Fukushima amounts to \u201c20 Hiroshima bombs\u201d, while the natural decrease in radioactivity caused by the disaster is far slower than that caused by an atomic bomb: one-tenth against one-thousandth of original levels after a year.\n\u201cWe should recognize from the start that just like , Fukushima I Nuclear Plant has released radioactive materials equivalent in the amount to tens of nuclear bombs,\u201d he said during his parliamentary testimony. \u201cThe resulting contamination is far worse than the contamination by a nuclear bomb.\u201d\nFurther criticism was levelled against authorities this week when \"\" revealed that shortly after the initial disaster Tokyo bureaucrats had failed to warn evacuees in the Tsushima district that wind patterns were blowing radiation spewing from the Fukushima site towards them. \nDespite the recent revelations, the ongoing fallout from the catastrophe has largely slipped from the mainstream international news agenda. Australian online publication \"Crikey!\" last week denounced the poor airing of contamination and accountability issues in the Japanese press, claiming it has been left to bloggers and social media to accurately portray the still-unfolding crisis.\nIt is in this context that unofficial citizen groups have begun conducting their own measurements of radiation levels at various sites around Japan. Yesterday, \"Al-Jazeera\" reported on one such group, called Safecast, whose US and Japanese investigators have discovered disturbing readings not identified by official government agencies. For instance, on August 7 the group uncovered ground readings of 20,000 counts per minute 28 kilometres from the stricken plant, well outside the government\u2019s 20-kilometre mandatory evacuation zone.\n\u201cGetting into this has showed us there is a lack of data everywhere,\u201d says Sean Bonner, the group\u2019s director.\nThe Al-Jazeera report also quotes Jyunichi Tokuyama, a specialist with the Iwate Prefecture Agricultural and Fisheries Department, who said he was shocked to find radioactive hotspots up to 300 kilometres from Fukushima. \n\"The biggest cause of this contamination is the rice straw being fed to the cows, which was highly radioactive,\" Tokuyama told Al Jazeera, reflecting fears about the effects of the disaster in terms of contaminated food supplies. \nIn the wake of the ongoing crisis, the Japanese government has pledged to reduce the country\u2019s reliance on nuclear power, reflecting widespread public concern."}

The new law, which would be effective from July\u00a01 next year, would seek to reduce Japan's dependency on nuclear power.\nThe new legislation would urge power utilities to cut costs by purchasing renewable energy from outside companies and private businesses. Japan's decision has been referred to as opening the door on renewable energy, which currently only contributes to six percent of Japan's energy sources.\nPoliticians have amended the bill, allowing the revised bill to pass through parliament later this month. Prime Minister who is pushing for the bill to be passed in return for his resignation, has stated that the 'feed-in-tariff on renewable energy will be set at a fixed price so that utilities are limited to purchasing electricity from renewable power generators. Kan hopes that this will encourage more business and private corporate partners to enter into the renewable energy market.\n\"As a medium-term revolutionary energy and environmental strategy, we have decided to start a thorough review of nuclear power policy and draw a roadmap for a reduction of the dependence on nuclear power\" Mr Kan said.\nLarge companies are concerned about the new legislation as it will continue to affect profit margins which are low due to power shortages and high priced exports. The bill was changed to reduce the surcharge for large power companies after complaints from the Japanese steel industry. If the scheme is launched then consumers will face an increase on electricity bills as utilities can pass their costs onto end-users. Despite the governments promise to cap the surcharge for the next ten years, there is no reference to it in the revised bill. \nLawmakers hope that by adding a provision requiring utilities to streamline their operations, the impact on consumers will be minimized.\nA third party group will be set up within the under the Agency for National Resources and Energy to ensure that the setting of fixed prices are fair and just."}

Camiroaga was nicknamed \"the Falcon of Chicureo\" (\"El Halc\u00f3n de Chicureo\"), because he raised several falcons in his hacienda in , Santiago Metropolitan Region.\nHundreds of Chileans gathered outside \"Televisi\u00f3n Nacional de Chile\" headquarters in Santiago shortly after the station reported the tragedy; people prayed and lit candles outside TVN's gates for the lives of Camiroaga and the rest of TVN's involved staff.\nOn Saturday, Chilean newspaper \"\" (\"The Last News\") put on its front page a headline saying \"The last flight of the Falcon\" (\"El \u00faltimo vuelo del Halc\u00f3n\") which generated controversy as Camiroaga had not been declared legally dead. The newspaper shortly changed the front page on its online version, however, the print edition continued to show the controversial headline.\nFour bodies were found on Saturday morning by local fishermen who are helping in the rescue; they were taken from the islands to Santiago's Medical Legal Service (\"Instituto M\u00e9dico Legal\") for identification, arriving 19:10 local time (22:10 UTC) at the Air Force Base. Their identities were made public at 21:30 local time (00:30 UTC) by the Minister of the Government General Secretary : Erwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez, from the Chilean air force crew; Galia D\u00edaz, from the National Council of Culture; Roberto Bruce, journalist of TVN's \"Buenos D\u00edas a Todos\"; and Silvia Slier, editor of \"Buenos D\u00edas...\".\nAn intact door, several knapsacks, including one belonging to Felipe Camiroaga, and some equipment, lead the local mayor to assume \"it was clear the plane crashed.\" Local councillor Felipe Paredes told Chilean media, \"[t]hese persons came [to Juan Fern\u00e1ndez] in one of the most tragic moments in my life. I lost many people of our community, many loved people, because of the [February 2010] tsunami, and they reached me out sincerely. [...] I can't wait for them to be here.\" Paredes was the last person to see the airplane in-flight, since he was in a control tower in the Robinson Crusoe Aerodrome.\nDefence Minister Andres Allamand said in a press conference on Saturday night that \"everyone died instantly when the crash happened.\" He added that, \"[b]ased on observations and the search we carried out with the Air Force commander, we have reached the conclusion that the impact was such that it should have resulted in the instantaneous death of all of those who were aboard the aircraft.\" \"We have peace of mind that Felipe [Camiroaga] died in a place he loved,\" TVN executive Mauro Vald\u00e9s told \"\".\n\"Televisi\u00f3n Nacional\" released a statement on Facebook on Saturday night: \"We profoundly lament to have to confirm that according to official informations given by the authorities, there are no survivors from the Casa C212 airplane that crashed in the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez archipelago on Friday 2 September evening. Within the list of deceased passengers, there are five persons from TVN's program \"Buenos D\u00edas a Todos\", which has caused deep sorrow in the whole family of TVN.\"\nOn Sunday morning, a televised mass was conducted in TVN's headquarters; some of the attendants were former Camiroaga's girlfriend Katherine Salozny, long-time friend , \"\" presenter , actor , TV host and producer , and executives from TVN. Mauricio Correa, executive director of \"Buenos D\u00edas a Todos\" said during the mass \"Our colleagues died complying a mission, the public television one, the same one that sometimes isn't understood, but that is right there.\" Kike Morand\u00e9 said: \"The best one died, Felipe [Camiroaga].\"\n\"Felipe [Camiroaga] was a host on the national show [\"Buenos D\u00edas a Todos\"] I was on today, playing soccer with [him] too ... it's news right now that he was in a plane crash ... please pray for him [...]\", , who was interviewed on Friday morning in \"Buenos D\u00edas a Todos\" by Camiroaga himself, said on Facebook. Latin celebrities such as , , , , , and Pope Benedict XVI sent condolences to Camiroaga's and the other twenty people's families, TVN reported.\nPresident Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era decreed two days of national mourning, on Sunday afternoon in nationwide address. \"The Government has decided to decree national mourning for the days of Monday and Tuesday of the forthcoming week, as a way to express solidarity with the families of the victims, and also the pain that has arisen throughout our country,\" Pi\u00f1era said. He also said that \"work is being done with the best technology to find the bodies of the victims,\" but added that he can't \"guarantee that the search will be successful in a 100 per cent. [...] We know the impact was very violent and the airframe dispersed in a wide area.\" Pi\u00f1era said that the causes of the accident are unknown at the moment, and added that weather conditions affected negatively the security of the airplane landing.\nThe body of Erwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez, from the Chilean air force crew, was taken to Antofagasta after a mass was performed in Santiago in his honour on Sunday. That same day, Roberto Bruce, one of the two TVN journalists and father of two, was cremated and interrated in Parque del Recuerdo Cemetery in Santiago. \"With tremendous pain we have just said goodbye to Roberto, our beloved fat [person],\" TVN journalist and presenter said on Twitter.\nOne minute of silence was held at the beginning of the football match between Chile and Mexico in Barcelona, on Sunday. On that same day, three books of condolences were set up outside TVN's headquarters.\nGeneral Maximiliano Larraechea said that \"at the moment there are no news on the search,\" as of Sunday 17:00 local time (20:00 UTC). However, at 18:15 local time (21:15 UTC) approximately, Commander in Chief of the Chilean Air Force Jorge Rojas told \"Chilevisi\u00f3n\" that mutilated bodies were found in the water; Defence Minister Allamand confirmed that the recovered bodies will be taken to the Medical Legal Service in Santiago, in order to identify them, at 18:50 local time (21:50 UTC). Allamand added that \"there are fears that not all bodies will be found,\" and that the plane \"was disintegrated on impact with the water.\"\n\"Chilevisi\u00f3n\" reported that at least three more people, including TVN actor , and singer , were originally going to travel to Juan Fern\u00e1ndez on Friday. Reyes, however, was told to not travel because \"there was no room for him\" by \"Buenos D\u00edas a Todos\" producer Carolina Gatica (who remains disappeared); Reyes was going to travel because he wanted to teach Juan Fern\u00e1ndez children \"acting techniques.\" Yunge, member of the \"Desaf\u00edo: Levantemos Chile\" group, was asked by Felipe Cubillos to not travel, because he wanted Yunge to complete a song he was working on. \"It is incredible,\" Yunge told \"Chilevisi\u00f3n\".\nThe airplane crash, according to \"El Mercurio\", is the worst involving a military plane since December 1982 when a Fokker F-27 twin-engine travelling from Santiago to crashed near , killing 46 people, including journalist Silvia Pinto."}

This special report examines the month's research into the illnesses in detail, with \"Wikinews\" obtaining comment from experts based in Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom ahead of the U.S. , which starts tomorrow.\nEleven genetic regions were identified; seven of these were for schizophrenia and five of those were hitherto undiscovered. The parallel studies, conducted separately, examined more than 50,000 people worldwide and identified two associated with both diseases.\nLittle is known about the two illnesses, each of which affects around 1% of people and is treated with strong medication. Bipolar sufferers experience extremes of mood \u2013 depression and mania, hence the previous name \u201cmanic depression\u201d for the illness. Schizophrenia is associated with hearing voices, chaotic thoughts, and paranoia. There is no known cure.\nThe latest research examined both the healthy and the afflicted, using computers to scan genomes. Inheritance was thought to be a factor from prior knowledge of the diseases as a familial trait, but the original desire had been to isolate a single faulty gene. Instead it has become apparent that the genetic factors are many; in the case of schizophrenia, at most around 30% of the genetic components are thought to have been identified.\nThe \u2019s Pablo Gejman, a lead researcher on the schizophrenia study, explained to \"Wikinews\" in a telephone interview from Buenos Aires, Argentina that \u201cOne of the goals of genetic research is to find druggable targets\u201d \u2013 to \u201cfind treatments at the root of the problem\u201d.\nWhilst noting that there is no guarantee the genetic code identified is druggable, Gejman named calcium-activated neurochemical channels in the brain as candidates for new drugs. The channels were linked to schizophrenia in the study.\nGejman explained that a genetic locus called mir137 \u201csuggests an abnormality of gene regulation.\u201d The diseases are so poorly understood that it is uncertain if they are in fact two components of a single spectrum, or even each comprised of multiple illnesses. \nThe new and \u201cprovocative data\u201d gathered showed the significant loci identified were \u201cnot part of the pre-existent hypothesis.\u201d Calling this \u201cinteresting\u201d, Gejman added that the team found no evidence that receptors are involved; current drug treatments target dopamine receptors. The findings are \u201cnot related to anything we thought we knew [about schizophrenia],\u201d he told our correspondent.\nQuizzed about the possibility variations in the genetic factors involved in expressing the diseases explained the variation seen in symptoms, Gejman was uncertain. \u201cWe will have the answer, probably, only when we sequence the whole [human] .\u201d He notes that the relationship between and is unclear, and that \u201cWe know very little of the genetic architecture of schizophrenia and\u201d other disorders.\nAt the time the results were published, participating scientist Professor Rodney Scott from the University of Newcastle in Australia said \u201cThe strength of this research is in the numbers. The findings are robust and give us a lot of statistical power to identify the genetic determinants of schizophrenia.\u201d Scott told \"Wikinews\" that \u201cIf any single centre tried to undertake such a study, it would require millions of pounds. Since it was a collection of data from across the world the costs were spread. In this era of financial difficulty it will become increasingly difficult to secure funding for this type of project even though the pay-offs will be significant.\u201d\nGejman expressed similar sentiment. \u201cThe research budget is not growing, which makes [funding] difficult,\u201d he said, though he felt the cost \u201cis not prohibitive because of the benefits.\u201d \u201cI think that it was money well invested\u201d and \u201cvery well spent for the future,\u201d he said, adding that organisations in Europe and the US were aware of the importance of such research. \nGejman also agreed on reliability \u2013 the study is \u201cVery reliable because of the sample size; that should provide robust results\u2026 [we] have worked with a much larger sample than before.\u201d Scott told us it was \u201ca highly reliable study\u201d that has the potential to lead to new treatments \u201cin the long run\u201d.\nAnother point was the two genetic loci identified as common to both \u2013 how much support do they lend to the notion the diseases are linked? \u201cUntil more information is available it is really only suggestive,\u201d says Scott. \u201cStrong enough to say there may be potentially a common pathway that bifurcates to give rise to two diseases.\u201d\n\u201cIt is an excellent demonstration,\u201d said Gejman \u201cbecause you have the same chains that are common to both disorders, in fact not just the same chains but also the same s.\u201d He stressed uncertainty in how strong the relationship was, however. \nScott said examining how the variation of genetic factors may translate into varied symptoms being expressed \u201ccertainly is a good target for future research\u201d; \u201cIt is not known how many genetic factors contribute to either of these diseases but it is likely that not all are necessary to trigger disease.\u201d \u201cNew questions will always arise from any major study,\u201d he told our reporter. \u201cCertainly, new questions about bipolar and schizophrenia are now able to be formulated on the basis of the results presented in the two reports.\u201d\nThese weren\u2019t the only studies to look at the two diseases together in September. The \"\" carried research by a team from the University of Oxford and King's College London that examined mortality rates in England for schizophrenia and bipolar sufferers. They found both groups continued to suffer higher mortality rates than the general population \u2013 whilst these included suicides, three quarters of deaths were down to ailments such a s heart conditions. General death rates dropped from 1999 to 2006, but sufferers below 65 saw their death rate remain stable \u2013 and the over-65 saw theirs increase.\n\"By 2006, the excess risk in these groups had risk to twice the rate of the general population, whereas prior to that it had only been 1.6 times the risk, so it increased by almost 40%,\" said Dr Uy Hoang of Oxford. The study looked at every discharged inpatient with a diagnosis of either condition in England in the relevant time.\nHoang said at the time of the research\u2019s release that doctors should devote attention to predicting and preventing physical illness associated with mental disorders. His study comes at a time when the UK has launched a \"no health without mental health\" strategy which does attempt to screen for physical illnesses coinciding with mental illnesses. The government aims to reduce the death rate of those with mental disorders.\nRodney Scott described this research result to \"Wikinews\" as \u201cPossibly\u201d connected to genetic association with other hereditary ailments, such as cardiovascular disease; he told us another possibility is that \u201cThe continued raised mortality rates may be associated with the diseases themselves.\u201d \n\u201cWe believe the NHS [] and Department of Health need to do more to support research and service development for people with bipolar disorder,\u201d \"Wikinews\" was told by Suzanne Hudson, Chief Executive of London-based British charity MDF The Bipolar Organisation. \u201cThe provision of specialist services for bipolar is very limited in the UK and the demand for our services is unprecedented.\u201d\n\u201cA genetic test for bipolar would be a useful tool but the science and ethics are very complex,\u201d Hudson told us, referring to the \"Nature Genetics\" genetic study. \u201cJust because someone has 'bipolar genes' does not mean they might go on to develop it. Family studies of bipolar show that this is a likely outcome of genetics research in this area. Even if it were possible to accurately predict bipolar in this way, questions about how you treat that person are difficult. For example do you start medication that is not necessary at that point in time?\u201d\n\u201cCurrent treatment is not satisfactory\u201d because it does not always work and has \u201cside effects,\u201d Gejman told us. Robert Whitaker, a US medical journalist and book author, told an audience in New Zealand at the end of August that evidence suggests antidepressant drugs may make children and teenagers worse \u2013 \u201cYou see many become worse and end up with a more severe diagnosis, like bipolar illness,\" and the suicide risk may increase. \nWhitaker blames commercial interests. \"The adult market appeared saturated, and so they began eying children and teenagers. Prior to this, few children and youth were seen as suffering from major depression, and so few were prescribed anti-depressants.\"\nOne possible alternative, raised by a connection between depressive illness and inflammation, is aspirin and similar compounds. \u201cThe link between inflammation and mood disorders has been known for sometime and the use of aspirin and other drugs in depression is now becoming more common in the literature,\u201d Hudson says. \u201cAny new treatments for bipolar, which is a very complex and illness, has to be a good thing.\u201d \nProfessor Dr. Michael Berk, chairman of psychiatry at Australia\u2019s , recently gave a talk to just this effect. Speaking at this year\u2019s Congress of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology, held this past month, he also highlighted s as a treatment. Recognising the link to physical ailments, he told an interviewer \"The brain does not exist in isolation, and we need to understand that pathways similar to those that underpin risks for cardiovascular disorders, stroke, and osteoporosis might also underpin the risk for psychiatric disorders, and that other treatments might be helpful.\"\nBerk also touched upon speed of diagnosis and treatment; \"Early interventions can potentially improve the outcome\" of bipolar sufferers, he told his audience. MDF The Bipolar Organisation claim an average of ten years is possible before a person is diagnosed. \u201cThis clearly is an issue, if we believe that earlier diagnosis and treatment facilitate better outcomes,\u201d Berk told \"Wikinews\". Though he questions the effectiveness of currently-used drugs on advanced bipolar cases, he does not go so far as to say drugs are actively harmful. He told us \u201cit appears that our best treatments work best earlier in the illness course; and that seems to apply to psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy.\u201d\nBerk has already performed research using statins which suggests they can form a treatment. He now seeks funding for research involving aspirin. On funding, he tells \"Wikinews\" \u201cpsychiatric disorders comprise between 16% and 22% of the burden of disability (depending on who measures it), attracts[sic] just over 6% of the clinical budget at least in Australia and 3% of the research budget. Research as a discretionary spending item is at great risk.\u201d\nBerk\u2019s research, in the past, has been funded by companies including . Hudson told \"Wikinews\" this did not concern her charity; in fact, they welcomed it. \u201cWe believe it is important pharmaceutical companies continue to invest in the development of new medications for bipolar. This is how it works in all other health specialities and mental health should be no different.\u201d\n\u201cThere is a need for greater education for mental health professionals and GPs [general practitioners] about bipolar [in the UK],\u201d she told us. \u201cAs the national bipolar charity we receive many, many calls and requests from GPs and other health professionals for our leaflets and information sheets which is fantastic. We very much welcome opportunities to work together for the benefit of individuals affected by bipolar.\u201d\n\"Wikinews\" contacted the UK\u2019s (NICE) to discuss issues raised in this article, including future treatments, genetic screening, and mortality rates. NICE did not respond.\nMight statins and/or aspirin improve treatment \u2013 might they be cheaper, perhaps, or safer? \u201cThis is an area of research promise,\u201d says Berk, \u201chowever it is too early to make any clinical treatment claims; [all] we can say is that this needs to be studied in properly designed trials capable of giving a more definitive answer.\u201d And what of possible explanations for the increased mortality rate observed in England? Should researchers look at whether bipolar influences more than just the brain, or if it is linked to other genetic conditions? \n\u201cFor sure,\u201d he told us. \u201cThere is new evidence that similar pathways contribute to the risk for both medical and psychiatric illness, both in terms of lifestyle factors, and biomarkers of risk.\u201d"}

Steve Jobs has died yesterday at the age of 56, according to the company website.\nOn August 24, Jobs resigned from his post as CEO. He has been fighting pancreatic cancer since 2004.\nJobs, born in San Francisco on February 24, 1955, has built the most valuable technology company in the world, with a market value of $348.8 billion. He started Apple in 1976, and in 1984 the first personal computer was released to the public. One year later he was fired from the company and he founded . In 1986 he bought Pixar which was acquired by The Walt Disney Company in 2005. In 1996, following Apple Computer's purchase of NeXT, Jobs returned to Apple and soon after reassumed the role of CEO. In 1998 Apple introduced the personal computer, in 2001 the music player and the following year the operating system was released. 2007 was the year of the smartphone, then the tablet computer in 2010.\nA statement on Apple's website, the homepage of which currently displays a black and white photograph and the text \"Steve Jobs 1955-2011\", states: \u201cApple has lost a visionary and creative genius, and the world has lost an amazing human being. Those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and work with Steve have lost a dear friend and an inspiring mentor. Steve leaves behind a company that only he could have built, and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple.\u201d\nUnited States President Barack Obama said \"Steve was among the greatest of American innovators \u2014 brave enough to think differently, bold enough to believe he could change the world, and talented enough to do it\".\nFormer Microsoft CEO Bill Gates responded to Jobs' death with a statement on his blog: \"The world rarely sees someone who has had the profound impact Steve has had, the effects of which will be felt for many generations to come. ... I will miss Steve immensely.\" The current Microsoft CEO also expressed condolences for Jobs and described him as \"one of the founders of our industry and a true visionary\"."}

The photograph clearly shows the woman's identity and the kitchen knife used to kill her that was still planted in her back. \n\"Habert\u00fcrk\" has been highly criticized by social media users, readers, celebrities, woman organizations, professional press organisations and even its own staff members, with some claiming violation of journalism ethics rules. Habert\u00fcrk\u2019s own staff columnist Balcicek Ilter said, \"the photo of the violated woman on my newspaper's front page is violence itself.\" \"Habert\u00fcrk\" reported her husband, 45, murdered the woman, 38, in .

We call for journalism in print and on TV that stands for the right perspective,\" said Canan G\u00fcll\u00fc from the Turkish Federation of Women Associations (TKDF).\nThe Press Council convened Sunday to find a solution to this matter and its Secretary General, Dr. Hasan Sinar states that \"Habert\u00fcrk\" has \"ignored the Press Council and the Professional Press Principles\" since mid 2009. \nWhile this article has caught a lot of negative attention, there are supporters of Habert\u00fcrk's choice in using the photo. Serpil Sancar, head of Ankara University\u2019s Women\u2019s Issues Center agrees stating, \"This photograph illustrates the violence women have to face. I don't think showing the truth is bad. Seeing blood sets the conscience in motion.\"\nSince talking with Brussels over European Union membership in 2005, Turkey pledged to strengthen human rights and the protection of women. Earlier this year reported \"Turkey\u2019s flawed family violence protection system leaves women and girls across the country unprotected against domestic abuse.\" The rate of female murders has increased 1,400% since 2004. \nThe 's commissioner for human rights, Thomas Hammarberg, is scheduled to be in Turkey currently. A report by Hammarberg earlier this year noted improvements in press freedom, but nonetheless claimed \"There is a need for immediate measures to defend these rights [freedom of expression and the media] and support an environment of tolerance to accommodate opposing views.\""}

Saturn.\nRoemer served four terms in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 1980s as a member of the Democratic Party. He was governor as a Democrat in 1987 before switching to the Republican Party ahead of the . That year, he lost the party's primary to state legislator . After his governorship, Roemer worked as CEO of Business First Bank in .\nRoemer announced his candidacy for president back in July after exploring a bid for several months. He has focused his campaign on the issue of , refusing to accept money from (PACs) and limiting individual campaign contributions to $100. He raised a total of $126,500 in the third quarter of 2011, far short of the $14.2 million raised by former Massachusetts Mitt Romney. \nFor his campaign, Roemer has adopted the slogan 'Free to Lead'. He rails against corruption, special interests, and money in politics, and has expressed support for the protests. Furthermore, he has taken issue positions in favor of , a balanced federal budget, and a strengthened national defense.\nRoemer has not been invited to any national presidential debates.

Pearson Cross of the commented, \"If Buddy can exceed expectations in New Hampshire or even sneak in and steal third \u2014 that would give a boost that he could build on\".\nInterview.\n Why did you decide to run for president at this particular point in time?\nWhy run now? The political system has become institutionally corrupt with special interest money in control. I run to reform the system.\n Why are you a better choice for the Republican nomination than any of your opponents?\nNo other candidate talks about the corruption of the political system as a result of special interest money. No other candidate limits contributions to $100 or less, no PACS, no SUPERPACS, full disclosure. No candidate has even stated a position on campaign reform. Our country is being bought and sold, and they have nothing to say. It is alarming and disgraceful. It is particularly bothersome as our country is in such difficulty with no jobs growth and lack of budgetary control and no solution is possible without exposing and placing broad limits on accepting special interest campaign funds.\nLobbyists and Pacs with DC addresses contributed more money to the two candidates four years ago than 32 States combined.\nI will propose to Congress the following reforms:\n Which of your fellow 2012 candidates for president do you most admire?\nRon Paul. Of course, I do not agree with every position, but on the and its management he has added a great deal to the debate. He has grown in relevance in my thoughts over the past 30 years since we served in Congress together.\n If you do not receive the Republican nomination, would you consider running as a third party candidate?\nI am a Republican and can\u2019t conceive of any other Party or position as a candidate. As President, I will work with both parties and independents to rebuild America.\n Do you believe Barack Obama has done any good things as president?\nI like his spirit of hope when he first came to DC. But he turned out to be just like the rest of them: money, money, money, money, money.\n What necessary freedoms are currently lacking in American society?\nFair Trade ought to be a freedom that we can count on. The freedom to compete on a level playing field, but the big boys have bought those in control and have advertised the phrase Free Trade and all our best jobs get shipped overseas with Unfair Trade. A family without work is not happy, not healthy, not free. Our greatest loss of freedom has been loss of jobs. I\u2019d get them back starting with Fair Trade and a level playing field with the biggest economic enemy of our great nation----China.\n Do you disagree with any parts of the current ?\nI would like to see a provision relating to money as speech with broad limits, full disclosure, and personal accountability. In that reform I would consider \u201cterm limits\u201d and non-political rules for reapportionment.\n How have your political views changed in the past twenty years?\nI am a who has learned to listen to other Americans. Listening is a gift that I was reluctant to accept in my early years. At 68, I have found listening makes life more fun, more meaningful, more satisfying.\n What are some of your policy proposals and if elected, how would you implement these?\nI believe in small business and think they need deregulation. I believe in and would encourage the market place to price all forms of available energy. I would open to nuclear waste storage. I would emphasize natural gas (clean and available). I would drill where there is gas and would do it cleanly. I would stop sending $700 BN to Saudi [Arabia] and its neighbors. I would cease all , particular oil and ethanol and unproven energy technology, and would close the ($25 BN). I would form an energy pact with Mexico and Canada and with no one else. I would institute complete tax reform and remove by instituting the (simple and fair and no national sales tax and a supermajority to change the rate). I would reduce Federal Spending 1% of GDP a year for 5-years. Under my leadership this country will explode economically.\nI would implement the above by taking a broom and sweeping out DC with new, informed citizen-leaders, by communicating with the American people on a frequent basis as I travel outside of DC, by being free of the special interest money, and by spending quality time and hours on task in building a team of Congressional reformers beginning with Republicans but including Democrats and independents. Reform, not \u201cchange\u201d will be the phrase, because the only way to beat a corrupt system is to reform it.\n Which individuals would you like to see in a Roemer administration?\nThose who have a record of reform in their home towns and local communities, and who pledge to put the peoples\u2019 interests first."}

Flippin has a week to appeal starting from yesterday's sentencing. His sentence also requires 80 hours of sexual violence education, and will be public for a decade. \nThe soldier had been part of a major US presence 35 km (22 miles) north of Seoul as part of a 28,000-strong force the US maintains in the nation to help protect its ally from North Korean hostilities, augmenting 650,000 active local soldiers.\nAlthough the US military is generally welcomed by the public, anti-US sentiment has been known to flare after incidents involving US troops. One prominent example in 2002 involved two schoolgirls killed by a US vehicle, with US soldiers acquitted by their country in a court martial. \nProsecutors in District Court had sought a fifteen-year sentence, which would match that handed to a US soldier in 1992 for rape and murder. That case saw calls for greater local powers over foreign soldiers and protesters demanded US troops leave the nation.\nPresiding justice Park In-sik said Flippin \"satisfied his sadistic and perverted sexual desire for three hours, [while] the victim was forced to endure fear and shame at her own home, where she was entitled to have her peace.\" He ruled the case was severe enough to warrant a sentence at the top end of the range, adding that Flippin's occupation was not a factor in the court's considerations."}

Before gifting the castle to the local people in 1923, Lord Leverhulme invested in electric lighting, central heating, an internal telephone system, and the extension of the ballroom for social gatherings. In World War II, the castle was the base for a Naval hospital and squadron of amphibious biplanes. Post-war, it spent 30 years as a technical college and school.\nIf the final tranche of funding is secured, in 2014 the castle will become the first-ever archive facility in the Western Isles.

The Close to home: older people and human rights in home care report is the result of a twelve-month investigation into care generally provided by local authorities.\nApproximately half of those receiving home care, plus friends and family, providing evidence to the inquiry were satisfied with the quality of care provided. However, the report stresses that there are \"systemic problems\" arising from \"a failure to apply a human rights approach to home care provision\". The report asserts that it is generally not the fault of individuals providing care, but serious problems exist as local authorities seem unaware of their obligations under the and fail to commission, procure, and monitor care accordingly. \nThe report says articles two, three and eight of the are frequently being breached. These, respectively, cover an individual's right to life, protection from inhumane and degrading treatment, and respect for dignity and personal independence. Criticisms include that care is not provided in a common-sense manner, and funding of care for the elderly is at lower levels than for younger people with similar problems and needs.\nThe EHRC's investigation highlights a range of recurring complaints and attempts to identify the underlying causes; cost is repeatedly mentioned, with use of the private-sector leading to some local authorities offering a \"one size fits all\" service leaving many elderly feeling they are \"a task to be undertaken\" and have \"little or no choice\" as to help received, or when care workers visit. A failure to invest in care workers is noted, with significant responsibility and the wide range of skills required being rewarded with low pay and status; this, the report states, adversely impacts staff retention and, a high turnover of care workers can put the security of care recipients at-risk.\nWithin the wider investigation, a commissioned independent social report by The Arndale Centre conducted in-depth interviews with a cross-section of 40 elderly individuals receiving home care. As-stressed in the report, those selected were not on the basis of good, or bad, experiences with their \u2013 mainly local authority-provided \u2013 care. It highlights a widespread feeling amongst those interviewed that they are treated \"like a number\", and that aspects of the care provided lead to, or fail to resolve, feelings of social isolation.\nThe Manchester-based Arndale Centre report concludes that, \"[t]he general picture is of a wider home care system in which older people are not\neffectively involved: which they do not understand, and which does not often make the extra effort required to involve them in ways tailored to their state of health and other needs\".\nA recurring theme in the responses of those interviewed is the social isolation that their home care is not adequately addressing. One male interviewee in his seventies who previously used a scooter to get about said in his interview, \"I haven\u2019t been out of the house now for about four weeks. I daren't. The last time I went out on the scooter I hit the kerb and it frightened the living daylights out of me.\" Another, an 85-year-old woman who lives alone, expressed sadness at her inability to do normal things, \"I would love to go to town to do some shopping. I haven\u2019t been to town for about two years... Wander round the town and have a cup of tea... I\u2019d love that.\"\nThe social isolation many elderly experience was summed up neatly by another woman in her eighties in her interview: \"When you go now, I will maybe not talk to anybody till tomorrow; maybe the whole of tomorrow nobody to talk [to]... face to face. Nobody will knock on that door, that is it, a life of isolation.\" \nThe EHRC, having commissioned this report in the face of funding changes and reform of the care system, intends to press for legislative changes to ensure those receiving care at home are given the same protections under the Human Rights Act as those in residential care. In the conclusions of their report they offer to work with, and support, local authorities in understanding and delivering care that respects peoples' rights and dignity; and, recommend better guidance as to the choices available to the elderly, and their families, be made available."}

The prosecution had contended Lee Anthony Evans trapped the boys in an empty house before burning it down.\nAlvin Turner, 16; Melvin Pittman, 17; Randy Johnson, 16; Ernest Taylor, 17; and Michael McDowell, 16 disappeared on August 20, 1978. Recently homicide detectives got involved and in March last year they arrested Evans and his co-accused Philander Hampton. Hampton, Evans's cousin, had told police in 2008 that the pair were behind the teens' deaths and, although witnesses placed the boys in Evans's pickup truck, his testimony alone linked Evans to the mystery.\nEvans represented himself through the majority of the case, although he did get his court-appointed lawyer, Olubukola Adetula, to take control of much of the trial's latter stages. The case has been on trial since October 28. It was Adetula who cross-examined Hampton.\nThe defense noted the poor record of drug dealer and user Hampton, who has spent time in jail for crimes including theft. He confessed in a plea deal that sees him sentenced to ten years in prison in exchange for his testimony, but will be eligible for parole within months as he has already served most of the two years required by 1978 guidelines.\nHampton testified Evans, who is now 58, burned the quintet alive in revenge after discovering they had broken into his property and stolen a pound of . Evans often offered odd jobs to the teens and Hampton said Evans brought the youths in two trips to the vacant Camden Street house on the pretense of helping move boxes. \nHampton, who is set to be paid 15,000 by the state to assist his relocation for his safety, testified he acted as a guard for the first two youngsters whilst Evans brought the second group; he claimed to have believed all that was planned was a stunt to scare the five. He further told the court that Evans imprisoned all five in a cupboard sealed by a solitary nail, pouring gasoline (petrol) onto the building's floors. Hampton said he gave Evans a match, who then set the house alight. \nOther witnesses described seeing the boys in the back of Evans's truck, and friends of the missing told the court the five had previously broken into Evans's home to steal the drug. All five had small quantities of cannabis in their rooms when they vanished. However, testimony was inconsistent; the time of the final drug theft was in dispute, and Evans made a point of inconsistencies in testimony about the last known sightings of the boys, claiming accounts of them in his vehicle had changed over time.\nThe house in question was destroyed by fire. Specially trained dogs and sonar equipment both failed to show any trace of bodies at the site and the defense pointed out police searched a second site, which they said implied Hampton's account was not fully believed. It took thirteen hours of questioning before Hampton volunteered his claims, and police spent a year attempting to find evidence to reinforce them without success.\nThe jury has been deciding its verdict since Friday and spent roughly twelve hours deliberating. Victims' relatives wept as the foreman read out the verdicts, and Michael McDowell's sister Terry Lawson insisted \"not guilty does not mean innocent. Mr. Evans may have escaped the law but never the lord.\" She nonetheless expressed gratitude the case went to trial. Multiple family members, including Lawson, have previously expressed confidence Evans killed their loved ones.\nEvans sobbed after leaving court, after asking Judge Patricia K. Costello to tell him \"You\u2019re dismissed\". \"Man, you won,\" a friend told him, but Evans said he did not feel a winner although he was glad of the result. \"That was the jury that wasn\u2019t the people... It's like someone put you in the oven and burned you up. You can't undo that.\"\nHe went on to claim officials and Newark mayor engaged in a corrupt conspiracy against him, with Brooker using the arrests to aid his re-election campaign; Evans claims the timing was no coincidence. Brooker denies the allegations. Evans contends he should never have been prosecuted.\nCostello has promised to later deal with what she called \"astonishing\" behavior by assistant prosecutor Peter Guarino. Retrials were twice sought by the defense and denied; once, he asked a witness if they knew of an unrelated murder by the accused's late brother. The other time a police officer appearing for Guarino as a witness mentioned a statement that two men were seen fleeing the fire; Costello had already said this was inadmissible evidence because the person behind the claim had since died. These incidents led to discussions without the jury present.\n\"[W]e are of course disappointed in the verdict, but respect the jury's process,\" said Essex County Acting Prosecutor Carolyn Murray. To answer a press question, she added \"with respect to this case criminally, this case is closed.\" "}

It had been the longest suspension bridge in Borneo.\nEyewitnesses described heavy traffic at the time of the collapse, and one survivor said he left his truck to investigate a traffic jam. Some people were left trapped by debris as the bridge came down. \"It happened so fast, only about 30 seconds,\" according to National Disaster Management Agency spokesman Sutopo Nugoroho.\nNational search and rescue head Daryatmo said yesterday cranes will attempt to move debris today, with new reports saying echo-sounding equipment will be used to check it is safe to begin lifting. It is believed the bodies of more victims will be found trapped in vehicles beneath the water, which is 35-40 metres deep. Visibility is poor, and one official explained authorities are still unsure how many vehicles are on the riverbed.\n\"The above-water search is continuing, but underwater operations have not been carried out because we're worried that the bridge's pylons are unstable and could collapse any time,\" said Nugoroho today. He explained that bodies had washed onto the riverbanks overnight and were recovered today.\nThe president, , has sent three ministers to the site to investigate the accident, while Bambang Widaryatmo, head of East Kalimantan's police, promised \"parties found to be negligent will be prosecuted\". The government has promised a replacement ferry service. The river is closed to boats as rescue operations continue, and a 22-strong team has been dispatched from the national police, comprising six forensics experts, five disaster victim identification specialists, and eleven investigators. They are there to augment the East Kalimantan Police. Health Minister Endang Rahayu Sedyaningsih yesterday visited survivors in Parikesit Hospital and promised them medical treatment at government expense.\nSome people swam ashore after falling, with the aftermath filled with screams. Survivor Syakrani, 24, yesterday asserted \"The authorities should have closed the bridge if it was under repair.\" His words were followed by a \"Jakarta Globe\" editorial declaring the accident \"unacceptable\".\nThe \"Globe\" went on to comment upon suggestions corruption may have played a role; \"It is too early to point fingers and look to place blame, but if shoddy materials were used in the building of the bridge, those responsible must answer to the public.\" Another suggestion is coal barges striking the bridge may have weakened it. Local coal company Harum Energy lost five percent of its share value today amid fears the river blockage will hamper their ability to ship coal.\nSamarinda's seen a population and construction boom lately. A few years have seen the population triple and the construction of a large mosque, and a sports stadium; an airport and port are set to follow. However, the Corruption Eradication Commission warns 70% of the corruption it investigates concerns government contracts and up to 40% of money earmarked for infrastructure ends up stolen."}

They found the times attempters said they'd tried suicide matched up with high levels of depression, and those who claimed to have attempted suicide had higher levels of depression than those who did not. The paper, published in this month's edition of the \"Journal of Adolescent Health\", concluded youngster's recollections of past suicide attempts appeared to be reliable.\n\"We are likely not giving kids enough credence in assessing their own mental health, and this study shows that we can rely on self-report measures to help identify youth who may be at risk for current mental health concerns, including possible suicidal behaviour,\" said lead researcher Professor James Mazza, an educational psychology expert.

Hoping to appeal to social conservatives, Texas Rick Perry released a commercial in Iowa entitled \"Strong\", in which he states, \"there's something wrong in this country when gays can serve openly in the military but our kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school.\" While the video received 24,407 likes by the end of the month, it received 725,698 dislikes. \nFrontrunner Newt Gingrich had trouble of his own after he suggested during an interview with \"\" that Palestinians were an \"invented people\".

The disputed material was first discussed three months ago.\nSibal calls the situation \"unacceptable\" and disputes the firms' defence of being merely \"platforms\" for others to add material.

All the material the government wishes to censor is \"absolutely illegal, defamatory, pornographic or other similar kind of material\" says Congress spokesman Abhishek Manu Singhvi.

In most cases there's just a single female that founded the population.\"\nAnother NCSU anthologist Zachary Adelman, not one of the researchers, said that the fact of different strains of bedbugs in the United States east coast \"means they're coming into the country from lots of different places\".\nThe discovery shows that pesticides are ineffective if they don't eliminate the entire population. Just a few survivors can produce a new generation within the house or building quickly; and, as the offspring of those surviving pesticide use, pass on their genetic resistance; emphasising Schal's remark that, \"[t]he insecticides really need to be robust\".\nCoby Schal said that for most species, limited diversity causes generic disorders and population does not survive, thus making the discovery a surprise. He said, \"But somehow bedbugs are able to withstand the effects of inbreeding, and do quite well.\" Schal was suggesting that as cockroaches inbreed successfully as well, its success may be related to the species' reliance on humans to relocate from place to place. The research is at preliminary stage, meaning the scientists may carry out more analysis before a final release."}

Beach confessed to a 1979 killing but has since maintained his innocence and now he's been granted a new trial.\nYesterday saw the state try a last-minute appeal to overturn District Judge E. Wayne Phillips's decision a few weeks prior to grant Beach a new trial. Phillips rejected that, and also declined a motion to stay Beach's bail hearing pending an appeal against the new trial to the . The state sought 250,000, but he was released on his own recognizance on the basis he has no money and has already served more time than people with similar convictions.\nThe case revolves around the murder of seventeen-year-old Kim Nees. The crime went unsolved until police arrested Beach for another offence and he confessed. No other evidence links Beach to the crime and he says his confession \u2014 in which he describes trying to kiss schoolmate Nees, being fought off, and hitting her with a tire iron and wrench \u2014 was coerced. Rumours have always abounded that a group of girls beat Nees to death near on the . \nBeach was convicted in 1984 of deliberate homicide. A 100-year prison term was handed down. The retrial will now have to focus upon a typed transcript of Beach's disputed confession with the original audio tape missing. There is no DNA evidence, and one of the points for retrial was local police making mistakes in how they treated the scant evidence from the scene at the time.\nBeach and supporters accuse several women of being behind the murder, who all deny involvement. However, as the years have gone by friends, family, and colleagues of these women have told of confessions describing a gang fight that went too far and the court heard this summer from a woman who was a youngster at the time of hearing shrill cries from a girl-on-girl attack. The judge called this \"extraordinarily credible and believable\". At least one of the accused girls has expressed disappointment at not being asked to defend her innocence at the hearing.\nBeach's case was statewide news in 2007 when the parole board held an unusual multiday hearing to consider sentence commutation or a pardon for Beach, which was ultimately rejected. Case prosecutor \u2014 who went on to be state governor and have a national political career \u2014 told the board of his certainty in Beach's guilt. The Montana Supreme Court's current chief justice and one-time Attorney General Mike McGrath said at the time \"I am grateful that the board has, in its own words 'laid this matter to rest.'\"\nFour points were raised by the state yesterday at appeal attempting to deny a retrial. All four were dismissed. The first was that Beach had little chance of success, the second that the court had not considered all the evidence, the third that the defence had no DNA evidence, and the fourth that there had been no breach of the Constitution.\nBeach will stay with James Ziegler, who has visited him in prison, by his own count, between eight and ten times a year since 1984. Ziegler said he and his wife would be \"honored\" to have Beach and will help him find work. He has been ordered by the court to report any breaches of bail conditions by Beach, who was freed 26 years to the day since he entered Montana State Prison.\nEven if reconvicted, Beach could be sentenced to time already served and remain a free man. \"We must not forget that Kim Nees was brutally murdered,\" Judge Phillips said. When ordering the retrial, he noted that he was not fully convinced of Beach's innocence."}

However, the new court ruling notes some details were reported by press and others were given to him by investigators asking .

The book includes 101 questions for students to use to challenge their climate science teachers.\nThe book follows Professor Plimer's 2009 \"Heaven and Earth\". Professor Plimer said the previous book received feedback from parents concerned about education. This prompted him to address the next book to children. He said, \"After Heaven and Earth came out I had many parents write to me and say, 'Look, what do we do, our kids are being fed activism. I want my children to have the basics of scientists, I don't want to be fed activism'\".\nMr Howard advocated emissions trading in 2007. He says he considered it feasible if the rest of the world acted too, otherwise to introduce carbon trading plans would risk Australian industries. \"I proposed an emissions trading scheme and some people say, 'Well why on earth did you do that?'

Last Sunday they also repelled an attempt by around a thousand police to retake the town using tear gas and water cannons.\nNegotiations were previously ongoing over the land dispute with villagers claiming farmland was taken, and sold to private developers , with no compensation provided to locals. However, recent remarks over the legality of the initial protests in September by a county-level spokesperson prompted a return to street protests last week in the province town.\nMass-protests on economic grounds are frequent in China. An average of around 15,000 protests occur each month. Local officials are frequently accused of requisitioning land, using police and thugs to intimidate rural farmers and complete \u2014 often illegal \u2014 evictions. Following this, and as seems the case in Wukan, the land is sold on to local developers and entrepreneurs with no compensation paid to the evicted.\nWhen rioting began this September in Wukan, State news agency said that eleven investigations into forced evictions which had led to violent protests were underway. A total of 31 local officials were facing potential criminal charges, with the reported cases of land grabs a mix of \"illegal\" and \"badly executed\" evictions. In at least one case, a forced eviction resulted in the death of a 48-year-old woman.\nFollowing on from the days of rioting over the land-grab in September, and the police's ruthless retaking of the town of 20,000, county government officials \u2014 in an exceptional move \u2014 commenced negotiations with representatives chosen by the villagers themselves. Until, that is, last week after a local official asserted the town's chosen negotiators were helping \"overseas forces that want to sow divisions between the government and villagers.\" This prompted a resumption of protesting \u2014 including a sit-in by the villagers.\nPlain-clothes police mounted an operation against the villagers last Friday, capturing five of the town's thirteen chosen representative\u2013negotiators. Amongst those seized was 42-year-old Xue Jinbo, who died in custody on Sunday. Villagers, including Xue's 24-year-old son-in-law, claim he was tortured and that, when visiting the funeral home where the body is being held, his corpse was bloody and bruised, and his thumbs broken. Xinhua disputes these claims, asserting the cause of death was a heart attack; and, that this occurred following Xue confessing to criminal involvement with the September rioting.\nNews of the uprising in Wukan is subject to censorship in China media \u2014 including through online censorship of micro-blogging sites. The BBC reports , the Chinese hybrid\u2013equivalent of Twitter and Facebook, returns the message: \"According to relevant law, regulations and policies, search results for Wukan cannot be displayed\" when a search for the town's name is made. It is being suggested that Chinese web users have switched to using the tag \"WK\", which can be taken as an abbreviation of either \"Wukan\" or \"What is going on?\" And, at-present the English-language website for Xinhua returns no search results for \"Wukan\", and none that are relevant to the revolt when searching for the province name, \"Guangdong\".\nNow under-siege from police, food and water are not being allowed into the town by Communist authorities, and residents are being prevented from leaving. Some town residents reportedly say they are able to obtain supplies from neighbouring villages, but it has also been reported Wukan only has enough supplies to last about ten days."}

The following year, a large number of US troops were sent into Iraq; the number of sectarian and insurgent attacks subsequently declined.\nThe Iraq War involved a maximum of over 170,000 US troops, stationed in Iraq at more than 500 bases.

They, alongside the defunct airline, had been accused of responsibility for killing 119 in a crash near Athens.\nAll 121 on board Flight 522 were killed but the prosecution did not charge manslaughter in relation to the two flight crew, deeming them partially responsible for their own deaths. The accident remains the worst air disaster to befall both Greece and Cyprus. Most victims were Cypriot tourists.\nThe Cypriot jet left Larnaca on August 14, 2005. It was headed for Prague in the Czech Republic. Contact was quickly lost with the aircraft, which flew itself as far as the Greek capital on autopilot. \nThe 's pressurisation system is believed to have been incorrectly set by maintenance and had knocked out German Captain Hans-Jurgen Merten and Cypriot co-pilot Pambos Charalambous. They never checked the system before takeoff, which had undergone testing prior to flight.\nAn alarm had sounded both on the ground and in the air but had been ignored by those flying, as the same alarm was used for a different problem and the pilots therefore misinterpreted the alarm. This design would later be cited by victims' relatives in a civil case against Boeing.\nAs the unresponsive jet entered Greek airspace two fighter jets intercepted. The air force reported back that the civilian craft's pilots were slumped over the controls. Passengers were similarly incapacitated. The plane reached \u2014 an intermediate stop in Athens was planned \u2014 by itself and then the area awaiting human input.\nThat input eventually came in the form of a trainee pilot working on-board as a flight attendant. Investigators believe Andreas Prodromou had used multiple crew oxygen cylinders to be the last conscious person on board. The fighter pilots were able to watch him enter the cockpit. \nF-16 pilot Panayiotis Athanasopoulos was the last person to see Prodromou alive. He previously told the trial of initially receiving no response when signalling the jet in an attempt to get the pilots to follow him, then discovering the flight crew unconscious. The captain was out of sight. He testified he also signalled people wearing oxygen masks in the passenger cabin with similar lack of response. Prodromou, 25, entered the cockpit as the jet began losing altitude. \nAfter trying but failing to resuscitate Merten, the fighter pilots saw the trainee pilot take over the controls himself in a bid to save the plane. He was out of time. By then the aircraft had been in the air for two hours, and it ran out of fuel before it could reach the runway. Although many were deeply comatose from lack of oxygen, everyone on board was still alive when the plane crashed into a mountain at , north of Athens.\nAthanasopoulos says he gesticulated to Proprodomou and signalled him to land upon getting his attention. The trainee pilot simply pointed downwards, after which he \"looked ahead and did not look towards me again as the plane went down\". The airliner struck the ground levelly on its underside after straightening out moments before impact. It was torn apart.\nThe following year saw an air accident report primarily citing human error, and an inquiry by ex-Judge Panayiotis Kallis. The Kallis report was never made public. Helios, which was renamed Ajet Airways, closed down in 2006. Helios and Boeing were sued by victims' relatives; they sought 76 million but reached a settlement for an undisclosed sum. The accident report had also blamed Boeing for an \"ineffectiveness of measures\" over the dual-purpose alarm system.\nThe five defendants were charged in 2008. The defunct airline and four senior staff members each faced 119 counts of manslaughter, and alternative counts of causing death by a reckless, thoughtless or dangerous act. This gave a total of 1,190 charges. Manslaughter carries a potential life sentence with up to four years available on the lesser charge. \"The charges concern two of the three most serious offences under the Cyprus penal code,\" deputy attorney general Akis Papasavvas said at the time.\nThe prosecution case was that the pilots were unfit to fly and the defendants were negligent in letting them at the controls. The state prosecutor therefore needed to prove the actions of Merten and Charalambous caused the disaster, as well as that those in the dock were responsible for their employment and aware \u2014 or ought to have been aware \u2014 of inadequacies in their competence.\nThe prosecution had noted the accused failed to seek references from , Merten's last employer. He lost that job owing to failings in his duties and was later the subject of Helios co-pilots' complaints. Charalambous was considered unlikely to achieve promotion to pilot and his ability to handle stress was questioned at trial.\nIn reaching a majority decision, two of the three judges noted Helios chief executive Andreas Drakos and managing director Demetris Pantazis would be acquitted even if the prosecution proved its case as they were not responsible for employing the pair. This fell to co-accused operations manager George Kikkides and chief pilot Ianko Stoimenov.\nIn any event, the verdict described \"a dead-end for any procedure of identifying the competence of Merten\" with only Jet2 among his previous employers being known to have a negative view of him. Subsequent official evaluations rated both him and Charalambous suitably competent to fly.\n\"The lack of any causal association between the defendants and the negligence they were charged with for the fatal accident completely disconnects the defendants with the accident,\" said the 170-page verdict. \"Regardless... [of] how the charges are viewed, they remain groundless and without supporting evidence. It's judged that this reason is sufficient to dismiss all charges and acquit all defendants.\" \nAssize Court President Charis Solomonides read the decision: \"we conclude, without reservation, that no case has been proven prima-facie against all the defendants in all the charges they face and therefore, all the defendants are acquitted and charges are dropped.\" Solomonides made repeated mention of an inability for the prosecution to link the pilots' actions to those on trial, and noted that therefore no assessment had been made of their performance that day.\nJudge Nicolas Santis dissented. Nonetheless, he too had criticisms of the prosecution. He said they failed to properly define 'competence' and called very few experts to testify. Victims' relatives shouted in the courtroom after he finished reading his opinion; cries included \"killers!\" and \"is this justice?\".\nVictims' relatives had in fact predicted the acquittal and blamed the state for what they characterised as a poorly presented case. Relatives\u2019 Committee president Nicolas Yiasoumis said \"It was common knowledge that proceedings were weak due to the phrasing of the charges.\" There were also renewed calls for publication of the Kallis report. Yiasoumis claimed the Kallis report reached different conclusions to those used at trial, and said \"We did not believe they could be convicted on the basis of the argument that they had not employed the appropriate staff.\"\nAttorney General Petros Clerides initially said an appeal will be decided upon once the decision has been read, and that the Law Office was presently studying it. Yiasoumis said relatives may take Cyprus to a European court over the case once Cypriot legal matters are concluded. Clerides has now confirmed an appeal will be filed, which the prosecution has two weeks to do. He defended the performance of those who prosecuted \"this titanic case\".

It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after a brief mention of some of the month's biggest stories.\nIn this month's edition on the campaign trail, the challengers to President Barack Obama react to the results of the New Hampshire Democratic Party primary, two new political parties choose their first presidential nominees, and an economist who announced his intentions to seek the nomination of answers a few questions for \"Wikinews\".\nSummary.\nInitially, it was reported that former Massachusetts Mitt Romney won the Iowa Caucus by eight votes over former Senator Rick Santorum, who surged in the polls just days ahead of it. Several weeks later it was revealed that Santorum actually won. Congresswoman dropped out of the race as the result of her sixth place finish. Romney went on to win the New Hampshire Primary the next week, with Ron Paul placing second. , who finished third, dropped out and endorsed Romney. \nAhead of the South Carolina primary, Texas governor Rick Perry ended his run and endorsed Gingrich. Gingrich received praise for his debate performances in South Carolina, and won the primary by a large margin over Romney despite a highly publicized interview with his ex-wife just before. By this point, the campaign had turned negative with Gingrich attacking Romney for his business past, and with Romney referring to Gingrich as a \"failed leader\".\nPresident Barack Obama delivered the address on January 24. It was widely viewed as his \"campaign kickoff\" for re-election, and included a populist message that labeled the nation's tax code as \"rigged for the super wealthy\". Following the address, Obama traveled to five campaign battleground states. \nJust ahead of the Florida primary, Gingrich won the endorsement of former candidate Herman Cain. Nevertheless, Romney held a five-to-one spending advantage and was able to win the state and all fifty of its delegates. He solidified his position as frontrunner for the Republican nomination.\nNew Hampshire Democratic Party primary results.\nThough the Republican Party's first-in-the-nation received the bulk of media attention earlier in January, the Democratic Party held a primary in the state as well.\nPresident Barack Obama was challenged by thirteen Democratic Party presidential candidates including performance artist , anti-abortion activist , and historian . In the end, Obama easily won the primary with 81 percent, which amounted to 49,080 votes. Though the percentage was in the range won by incumbent presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush during their respective parties' primaries in 1996 and 2004, the vote total was about 5,000 less than Bush received in 2004, and almost 30,000 fewer than Clinton in 1996.\nOut of the candidates on the ballot, Ed Cowan of Vermont finished second behind Obama with 975 votes or 1.56 percent. Cowan's percentage was greater than that achieved by the Republican Party's 2004 New Hampshire primary runner-up Richard Bosa who finished with 1.2 percent, and greater even than comedian 's 1.1 percent second place finish in 1996.\nThe result surprised even Cowan, who said \"More people voted for me than I actually met... I passed out about 500 copies of my stump speech, 550 at the most. Officially (based on my receipts) I spent $580, but it might have been as much as $650 tops. That resulted in 1.5 votes per dollar spent\". Cowan hopes to enter additional primaries, and hints that he may be thinking about an independent run; \"The only vote that matters in the long run is the one on 11/7/12 [U.S. Election Day], and I hope to be on most if not all ballots.\"\nVermin Supreme of Massachusetts came in third with 833 votes or 1.37 percent. In response to the results, Supreme exclaimed, \"I WON !!!!!\" In fact, Supreme has received notice: a recent video for the popular YouTube show \"Songify the News\" included a clip of his glitter bomb of fellow candidate Randall Terry. It has received over one million views.\nTerry finished fourth with 442 votes. He told \"Wikinews\", \"we did what we set out to do: we injected the plight of unborn babies into this primary; hundreds of thousands of people in New Hampshire, Maine, and Boston saw the victims of Obama's policies: dead babies.\"\nJohn Haywood was close behind with 423 votes. When asked for his reaction to the results, he stated: \"when you're beaten by a ratio of 115 to 1, you don't exactly go whoopee, do you? I am, nevertheless, tremendously proud of my platform at haywoodforpresident.com.\"\nDarcy Richardson, who was interviewed by \"Wikinews\" last November, finished with 264 votes. He hypothesized that his ballot position and the fact that he did not travel to New Hampshire contributed to the low vote total. He remarked: \nOf the other candidates, Aldous Tyler received 106 votes, John Wolfe, Jr. received 245, Bob Ely received 287, Craig Freis received 400, Bob Greene 213, Robert Jordan 155, Cornelius O'Connor 266, and Ed O'Donnell 222. There were several thousand write-in votes including 2,289 or 3.77 percent of the total for Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul. Republican candidates Mitt Romney and Jon Huntsman, Jr. each also received over one thousand write-in votes.\nNew parties select presidential nominees.\nBoth the and the (A3P) selected their first presidential nominees in January. \nOn January 12, the A3P nominated Independent filmmaker for president and selected retired professor as his running mate. The party was founded in 2010, and promotes politics and . According to Miller's campaign manager Alex Carmichael, it is currently petitioning to appear on the Ohio ballot, and plans to do so in a dozen other states.\nThe next day, the Justice Party nominated former mayor , who had formed the party a few months before. It supports accountability through the removal of corporate money in politics, and is currently on the ballot in several states. \nThe party did not reach the deadline to file in California, and Anderson decided on January 9 that he would seek the nomination of the socialist , which has attained ballot access in the state. Others competing for the party's nomination include nominee , nominee , and Stephen Durham of the .\nEconomist running for president.\n economics professor announced in early January that he intends to seek the presidential nomination of , an independent organization hoping to nominate a bipartisan ticket for the 2012 presidential election. The group says it has already achieved ballot access in fifteen states, and hopes to appear on all the rest. Former Louisiana governor has also expressed his interest in the nomination. \nKotlikoff, who filed with the FEC on January 12, has authored fifteen books and is a regular contributor at . As an economist, he has consulted for large corporations, central banks, national governments, and international bodies such as the . The policy basis of his run is the \"Purple plan\", a tax proposal that he believes both Democrats and Republicans can support.\nKotlikoff took some time to discuss his campaign with \"Wikinews\".\nIf elected president, what specific policies would you promote, and how would you work with a likely Republican congress to implement them?\nWhat are your views on the Stop Online Piracy Act? How would you address the issue of online piracy as president?\nWhat are your thoughts on fellow AE presidential candidate and former Louisiana governor Buddy Roemer? If he wins the AE nomination, would you consider running as an Independent?"}

The Friday morning hearing could pave the way for a vote in the Senate, but House Democrats could still prevent a vote by staying away from the House floor.

Valerie Jarrett, a White House adviser, said it was a \"very, very important step.\"\nThe new definition defines rape as: \"The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.\"\nDescribing the changes to as \"long overdue\", said the revised definition of rape will, \"help ensure justice for those whose lives have been devastated by sexual violence and reflect the Department of Justice's commitment to standing with rape victims\".\nThe prior definition of rape \u2014 \"the carnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will\" \u2014 was set by the FBI in 1927.

Worldwide, at least two million children are estimated to be trafficked victims of the sex trade; and, in military conflicts, it is not uncommon for children to be forced to bear arms. In releasing the report last year, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton highlighted the importance of international cooperation in addressing trafficking, and cultural issues associated with it.\nUnder the United Nations' , human trafficking encompasses cases where victims are born into slavery, forcibly transported for exploitation, consented to work with a trafficker, and/or were forced to participate in criminal activities. The Protocols also recognize the unique status and rights of children.\nUS-based action.\nReports from across the United States show a number of communities taking local action to solve, or otherwise highlight, this global problem.\nIn Southern California, Sister Caritas Foster is an advocate for the area's victims of human trafficking. Commenting on the area's involvement, she stated: \"We in the San Francisco Bay Area are one of the largest receiving areas with our borders and coasts\". For over four years, Foster has worked on educating the public on human trafficking, speaking to civic and religious groups and describing the power traffickers hold over their victims through vivid accounts of situations trafficked individuals find themselves in. Many have no idea where they are located, suffer under the constant threat of deportation, and most often lack the language abilities to seek help.\nLos Angeles politician Don Knabe said human trafficking was not a distant problem but one that hits close to home. As the county supervisor overseeing the fourth district in Los Angeles County, Knabe cited figures from the Probation Department showing 84 percent of arrests of children on prostitution charges in 2010 were in his district; he believes the overall problem for the county is much larger, and wants the Probation Department to establish a special unit dedicated to sexually exploited minors.\nNorthward in , Washington, members of the King County Sheriff's department realized that law enforcement had to deal supportively with the symptoms of human trafficking \u2014 rather than putting victims in jail. This gave birth to the \"Genesis Project\" where sheriff's deputies offer potential victims of trafficking a comfortable safe haven with amenities for 24 hours, and put them in touch with social services for counselling, job training, and education advice.\nPoliticians from several states have sought to address the connection between tourism and human trafficking; Indiana's state Senate unanimously passed a human trafficking bill on Tuesday morning. Current legislation only considered forced marriage and prostitution as human trafficking; loopholes in the existing laws allowed some forms of human trafficking to escape prosecution. Lawmakers in the state hope to toughen their human trafficking laws, and have new legislation on the statute books in time for the , due to be held in on February 5. The just-passed bill now goes to the House for approval.\nAlso on Tuesday, lawmakers from Hawaii held a special hearing on human trafficking. Kathryn Xian, of Pacific Alliance to Stop Slavery, says traffickers capitalize on the state's tourist-based economy. She introduced a package of seven bills she says will help prevent human trafficking in the state.\nAt a national level, the US government continues to work abroad on the issue of trafficking; Luis CdeBaca, a special ambassador for human trafficking, is working with Myanmar, commonly known as Burma, as the country seeks to improve diplomatic relations with the United States. Myanmar was identified by the US State Department as having one of the worst records of forced labor, and as a country that lacks necessary laws to curb human trafficking.\nTrafficking, the global picture.\nAlthough National Human Trafficking Awareness Day is a US-based effort to recognise, and highlight, this issue \u2014 as a topic of global concern being highlighted through the United Nations, others around the world continue efforts to increase public awareness and tackle trafficking.\nForty-six women from the international group Operation Mobilization sought to raise awareness by climbing Tanzania's . The summit is called \"Uhuru Peak\", with \"Uhuru\" meaning \"freedom\" in . Each of the non-professional climbers raised 10,000 to help those affected by human trafficking.\nIn the Middle East, several countries are reported to have problems with human traffickers recruiting unemployed gay Kenyan men to become sex slaves. Saudi Arabia and Qatar are supposedly the more-common destination countries into which Kenyans are lured with offers of high-paying jobs. However, in the United Arab Emirates \u2014 where no law prohibits trafficking, but homosexuality is illegal \u2014 the problem is compounded.\nEnforcement of existing laws, and acting against trafficking, are seen as key steps in reducing the activity. Showing that no country is unaffected, Northern Ireland police are currently investigating five sex trafficking cases; and, on Monday, Filipino police rescued fifteen women following a tip-off regarding women recruited, and being held, prior to being sent to work abroad.\nIn the Northern Ireland situation, Detective Superintendent Philip Marshall stated that fifteen men are to be contacted, suspected of having paid for sex with trafficked women. Identifying victims within the UK, or victims seeking help, is becoming more challenging with the sex industry having switched to using hotel rooms as-opposed to street corners. Many victims of trafficking are found to be unaware of where within the country they are.\nIn the Philippines situation, police are still seeking the recruiter of the fifteen women rescued in Rio Hondo.\nA range of complexities are involved in the sentencing of both those convicted of human trafficking, and their victims. In one Canadian case, 43-year-old Hungarian Lajos Domotor pled guilty to trafficking men and women into forced labor. Following being charged with conspiracy to commit human trafficking, he developed terminal stomach cancer and has been given a 10 to 15 percent chance of living five years.\nIn the UK, officials are seeking to detect exploitation prior to sentencing \u2014 as a counter to the high number of foreign women in jails, frequently having been victims of trafficking. One in seven women prisoners across England and Wales are foreign, with the primary offenses being drug or immigration-related. A report into the issue recommends sentencing decisions should consider the role of women, and of coercion, in such cases.\nArtists also have a special role to play in the education and awareness of the public. The first opera about sex trafficking will premiere in Liverpool, England, on March 7. \"Anya17\" was composed by Adam Gorb with a libretto written by Ben Kaye. Performers will come from Manchester's Royal Northern College of Music and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic contemporary music ensemble 10/10.

This follows his narrow victory in the last week. Congressman Ron Paul, who finished third in the Iowa Caucus, came in second with 56,872 votes (22.9%). Former Utah , who spent a great amount of resources on the primary, came in third place with 41,783 votes (16.8%).\nThe New Hampshire primary, the first primary of the election, is the second in a series of state elections that help to assign delegates to candidates to determine the presidential nominee of the Republican Party. Delegates can also be assigned from members of the , though these are unpledged and subject to change. To win the nomination, a candidate must accumulate 1,144 delegates. \nWith his victory, Romney claimed seven delegates to increase his total to 25 with unpledged delegates included. Paul won three delegates for his finish to total ten delegates, placing him second overall to Romney. Despite his third place finish, Huntsman is currently sixth overall in delegates with only the two he won in New Hampshire. He currently trails former Senator Rick Santorum who has compiled eight delegates overall, followed by Texas governor Rick Perry with four, and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich with three.\nIn his victory speech, Romney criticized President Barack Obama, saying he \"wants to turn America into a European-style entitlement society,\" countering that he himself wants \"to ensure that we remain a free and prosperous land of opportunity.\" Romney received a call following the results from Paul, who offered his congratulations. Paul mentioned afterwards that \"He certainly had a clear-cut victory. But we\u2019re nibbling at his heels.\" Paul, a , added, \"I have to chuckle when they describe us as being dangerous. That\u2019s one thing they are telling the truth [about]. Because we are dangerous to the status quo in this country!\" \nThough some Huntsman supporters were disappointed with their candidate's third place finish, Huntsman stated his \"confidence in the system is reborn because of the people of New Hampshire\". He announced he would remain in the race and head to South Carolina for that state's primary on January 21.\nGingrich finished in fifth place with 23,291 votes (9.4%) slightly behind Santorum who won 23,408 votes (9.4%) despite the surge from his strong showing in the Iowa Caucus. Perry, who did not focus on New Hampshire after the Iowa Caucus, finished with 1,764 votes (0.7%).\nThe campaigns now head to South Carolina, where all six major candidates still in the race will compete. The latest \"We Ask America\" poll from South Carolina shows Romney with 26 percent, ahead of Gingrich with 21 percent and Santorum with 13 percent."}

The blackout will start at midnight EST (05:00 UTC) on Wednesday. The action was confirmed on Monday night with three Wikipedia administrators closing one of the most commented on policy discussions in the history of Wikipedia. According to the Wikipedia page where the issue was debated, 479 users supported a blackout only for users in the United States (with other readers seeing a banner instead), while 591 supported a global blackout.\nUsers who visit the site during the blackout will see a message which asks them to email their Representatives and Senators. A number of other websites are also taking part, including the social media site , the blog, and the sites owned by . Google also announced that they would have a link on their homepage opposing SOPA and PIPA.\nSupporters of the blackout claim that the proposed laws would pose \"an existential threat to Wikipedia\", and that a shutdown would be a \"graphic method of driving home the point\". Opponents instead argue that the blackout threatens Wikipedia's neutrality (one opponent wrote that \"[a]ny action of this sort from Wikipedia's side will undermine the public's perception of Wikipedia as a politically neutral website\") and that it risks becoming involved in politics. Other opponents claimed that \"SOPA does not directly endanger Wikipedia\".\nIn a public statement, Sue Gardner, the Executive Director of the Wikimedia Foundation, responded to the charge made by opponents of the blackout: \"In making this decision, Wikipedians will be criticized for seeming to abandon neutrality to take a political position. That\u2019s a real, legitimate issue... although Wikipedia\u2019s articles are neutral, its existence is not\".\nThe co-founder of Wikipedia, Jimmy Wales, instead took to the microblogging service Twitter to express his views on the blackout, telling students to \"do [their] homework early\" to avoid not being able to access the site. Wales also said: \"This is going to be wow. I hope Wikipedia will melt phone systems in Washington on Wednesday.

Dodd went on to claim that the blackout actions are \"irresponsible\", \"dangerous\" and \"a disservice to people who rely on them for information and use their services\"."}

The protest mirrors similar actions from other websites including and . The White House stated on Saturday that they \"will not support legislation that reduces freedom of expression, increases cybersecurity risk, or undermines the dynamic, innovative global internet\".\nIn the midst of the Wikipedia blackout, executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation Sue Gardner answered some questions posed by \"Wikinews\"' Tom Morris about the effectiveness of, and background to, the blackout.\n Do you think the blackout is going to actually be effective?\n Yes. In my opinion, the blackout has two main goals\u2014to raise awareness about the dangers of and , and to encourage readers to contact their elected representatives and give their views. The first has already been accomplished: there are already more than 4,000 stories in about the blackout, and it was a trending topic on Twitter almost immediately. So we know we've been effective in raising awareness. What remains to be seen how many people will contact their elected officials.\n What do you say to people who have decided to leave the editing community as a result of the blackout?\n I hope nobody stops editing Wikipedia because of the blackout. I watched the community decision-making process unfold on the English Wikipedia, and I thought it was a good one. People first started talking about SOPA more than a month ago. Jimmy started the straw poll in mid-December. Over 1,800 English Wikipedians from many different countries participated in the discussion over the last three days. As the admins who closed it noted, this is by far the largest-ever number of participants in a community discussion on English Wikipedia, and the overwhelming majority of them supported action. So I would hope that anybody who opposes the blackout would also agree that the decision-making process was a good one, and would therefore be okay to accept it, however reluctantly.\n How much technical planning went into the blackout before the community consensus was decided on Monday night?\n Last Thursday Geoff Brigham [Ed: Wikimedia's legal counsel] asked engineering to do an internal assessment of the technical implementation requirements, because the community discussions at that point were suggesting there would likely be some kind of action. Engineering did an initial assessment based on e.g. the Italian blackout, implications for search engines, etc., and then a lot of work happened over the weekend. The bulk of initial development and testing happened on a sprint on , a public holiday in the United States, and the final launch development and testing sprint happened on Tuesday.\n Does the fact that this is affecting only English Wikipedia and not the sister projects and other language projects concern the Foundation?\n No. My understanding is that the English Wikipedia is the only project and language-version enacting a blackout, but that several other projects and language versions are putting up supportive banners, with the Italian Wkipedians doing a clickthrough informational interstitial. The German Wikipedia decided to put up banners even before consensus was reached on the English Wikipedia, and the Arabic Wikipedia, Italian Wikipedia and Commons later made the same decision. (There may be others, that I don't know about.) I think that's fine: each project and each language has different circumstances that argue for different types of action, or for no action. There is no one right answer that fits everybody.\n Some have said that the lack of participation by opponents of SOPA in the commercial sector (sites of the size of Twitter, Facebook, Google etc.) is going to hamper the effectiveness of the blackout \u2013 is this a concern?\n No. I don't think anybody ever expected the big commercial sites to black out: most aren't in a position to participate in something like this even if they wanted to. For example, they might have shareholders to answer to, participation might cost them significant revenue, or it could break contractual agreements (such as a commitment to maintain a certain level of uptime, or some other service delivery). Most sites are constrained by various commercial considerations: that makes Wikipedia's participation particularly powerful and important.\n Given both the Italian shutdown and the SOPA blackout, is the Foundation going to come up with a policy or set of conditions which limit when these kind of things happen? There are plenty in the community who support the SOPA actions but are concerned that this will set a bad precedent.\n Yeah, I empathize with those people and to a certain extent I share that concern. The Wikimedia movement does not have a lot of experience with advocacy, and probably mistakes will get made. At this time the Wikimedia Foundation doesn't have any plans to develop policy governing protests or advocacy work. But, I think it probably does make sense for the Foundation to create venues for these discussions so people can share thinking and expertise. So for example, we may create a mailing list dedicated to advocacy/lobbying. And there is some good thinking starting to happen ]."}

Outside the WEF security cordon, in the sub-zero temperatures of ' train station car park, the local incarnation of the are setting up 'Camp Igloo'; but, with little hope of the archetypes of , 'Davos Man', arriving by public transport and seeing their sub-zero protest.\nDavid Roth, heading the Swiss centre-left's youth wing \u2014 and an organiser of 'Camp Igloo', echoes much of the sentiment from 'Occupy' protests around the world; \"[a]t meetings the rest of society is excluded from, this powerful '1 percent' negotiates and decides about the fate of the other 99 percent of this world, [...] economic and financial concentration of power in a small, privileged minority leads to a dictatorship over the rest of us. The motto 'one person, one vote' is no longer valid, but 'one dollar, one vote'.\"\nRoth's characterisation of \", a term coined by the Professor of , is more emotive than that of the late professor who saw 'Davos man' as \"[having...] little need for national loyalty, view[ing] national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing, and see[ing] national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the elite's global operations\".\nAs \"Reuters\" highlights, many attendees will opt to make their way from Zurich to Davos by private jet, or helicopter, and the WEF itself provides handouts indicating the cost of such is 5,100 Swiss francs (approx. 5,500 USD, 3,500 , 4,200 EUR). In contrast: travelling by rail, even when opting for first class \u2014 without an advance booking, is 145 Swiss francs (approx. 155 USD, 100 GBP).\nShifting fortunes see several past attendees missing this year's exclusive get-together in the alpine resort; for a second year running \u2014 and now caught up in the UK phone hacking scandal being scrutinised by Lord Leveson's inquiry \u2014 media mogul will not be attending. Nor will the former head of financial services company Oswald Gruebel, who resigned in the wake of US$2.3 billion losses incurred through unauthorised trading; likewise, Philipp Hildebrand, the ex-head of the , is absent following scandal associated with his wife's currency trading activities; and, although the sexual assault charges against Dominique Strauss-Kahn were dropped, having stepped down as managing director of the International Monetary Fund Strauss-Kahn will also be absent.\nAs the #OccupyWEF protesters were building igloos last weekend, an anti-WEF protest in the Swiss capital was broken up by police, who stated their intent to prosecute participants in the illegal protest. Allegations of calls for violent protest action led to a high number of officers being involved. In the aftermath, charges of breach of the peace are to be brought against 153 people, with some targeted for more serious offences. At least one group involved in the protest described the police response as \"disproportionate\".\nAt 'Camp Igloo' Roth says he is seeking discussions with the WEF's expected 2,000 attendees; but his voice, and that of others in the worldwide 'Occupy' movement, is unlikely to be given a platform in the opening debate, \"Is 20th-century capitalism failing 21st-century society?\" He, and others taking part in this Swiss incarnation of the 'Occupy' movement, are still considering an invite to a side-session issued by the World Economic Forum's founder, ; commenting on the invite Roth told the \"Associated Press\" they would prefer a debate at a more neutral venue.\nA changing landscape of risks.\nAs has been the case for several years now, the annual Forum meeting in Davos was preceded with the release of a special report by the World Economic Forum into risks seen as likely to have an impact the in the coming decade. The 2012 Global Risks Report is a hefty document; the 64-page report is backed with a variety of visualisation tools designed to allow the interrelations between risks to be viewed, how risks interact modelled, and their potential impacts considered \u2014 as assessed by the WEF's panel of nearly 500 experts.\nAs one would expect, economic risks top both the 2012 impact and likelihood charts. Climate change is pushed somewhat further down the list of concerns likely to drive discussions in Davos. \"Major systemic financial failure\" \u2014 the collapse of a globally important financial institution, or world currency, is selected as the risk which carries the most potential impact.\nHowever, \"Chronic fiscal imbalances\" \u2014 failing to address excessive government debt, and \"Severe income disparity\" \u2014 a widening of the the gulf between rich and poor, top the list of most likely risks.\nAt the other end of the tables, disagreeing respectively with the weight last year's \"Wikinews\" report gave to , and the 's (MPAA) fight with the Internet over copyright legislation, the 2012 Global Risks Report places \"Proliferation of Orbital Debris\" and \"Failure of intellectual property regime\" bottom of the league in terms of potential impact.\nIn 2011, with the current global economic crisis well under-way, \"Fiscal crises\" topped the WEF risks with the largest potential impact in the next ten years. However, perceived as most likely a year ago, \"Storms and cyclones\", \"Flooding\", and \"Biodiversity loss\" \u2014 all climate-change related points \u2014 were placed ahead of \"Economic disparity\" and \"Fiscal crises\".\nMore mundane risks overtake the spectre of terrorism when contrasting this year's report with the 2011 one; volatility in the prices of commodities, consumer goods, and energy, and the security of water supplies are all now ranked as more likely risks than terrorism \u2014 though the 2011 report did rank some of these concerns as having a higher potential impact. A significant shift in perception sees the 2012 report highlight food shortages almost as likely a risk the world will face over the next decade; and, one with a far more significant impact.\nDealing on the Davos sidelines.\nAttending the World Economic Forum at Davos is more than just an opportunity to discuss the current state of the global economy, and review the risks which face countries around the world. With such a high number of political and business leaders in attendance, it is an ideal opportunity to pursue new trade deals.\nCanadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper is, in addition to being a keynote speaker, expected to pursue improved relations with European and Asian trade partners at private meetings on the Forum sidelines. The \" reports Harper is likely to push forward an under-negotiation Canadian-European free-trade agreement, and hold closed-door discussions prior to next month's planned trip to China.\nSimilarly, Canadian trade minister is expected to meet South Korean counterparts to discuss an equivalent deal to the preferential ones between the Asian nation and the US and Europe. Fast's deal does, however, face opposition at home; the union asserts that such a deal would put 33,0000 jobs at-risk.\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron and chancellor George Osborne are expected to discuss a possible increase of UK funding to the International Monetary Fund (IMF); however, with the UK responsible for 4.5% of the US$400 billion in the IMF's lending fund, backbench MPs have warned that committing any additional funds could provoke a Conservative revolt in parliament. Tuesday's IMF cut of predicted global growth from 4% to 3.3%, warnings of a likely Eurozone recession in 2012, and ongoing problems with Greek financial restructuring, are likely discussion topics at Davos \u2014 as well as amongst UK backbench MPs who see adding to the IMF war-chest as bailing out failed European economies.\nSouth Africa, less centre-stage during the 2011 Forum, will be looking to improve relationships and take advantage of their higher profile.

Talk increased of someone else entering the GOP race if Romney lost Michigan.\nSantorum's rise and the administration's new contraceptive mandate brought social issues to the forefront of the GOP race. The role of church and state gained prominence as Santorum remarked that hearing President 's 1960 speech on separation of two, \"makes him throw up\". After a poor performance in the month's final GOP debate, Santorum began to fall in the Michigan polls.

Parliamentary advocate James Ogle, the only candidate listed on the ballot, edged \"uncommitted\" 52.7 percent to 47.3 percent to win the majority of votes. This was something a Libertarian candidate could not accomplish during the 2008 primary, when \"uncommitted\" won a plurality.\nOgle has operated and promoted a fantasy government project based on the of voting since 1993. It is known as the USA Parliament. Ogle believes his username for the project \u2014 Joogle, a combination of his surname and first and middle initials \u2014 served as a basis for the name of the search engine ; for his campaign, he uses the slogan \"Go Ogle\".\nTo appear on the Missouri ballot, Ogle paid a filing fee of $1000. He was the only Libertarian candidate to do so. Ogle thinks this happened because he is \"accessible\" in comparison to his opponents, \"perhaps the other candidates couldn't be reached, and since there was about a 48 hour deadline to file the papers, they either didn't want to spend the $30 on overnight postage, they simply didn't know or else they didn't want to file.\" Other candidates for the Libertarian Party nomination, who missed the ballot, include former New Mexico , former air traffic controller , and activist .\nJust before the primary, an article in the \"Missourian\" newspaper chronicled Ogle's campaign. He believes this contributed to his victory. In the story, he \"was able to explain about ranked choice voting, the Libertarian's philosophy of the non initiation of force, smaller government and more liberty.\" In addition, the report mentioned Ogle's desire to be the running mate of Green Party presidential candidate Roseanne Barr.\nAccording to Ogle: \"the combination of all these events, somehow could have prompted more to ask for the Libertarian ballot when they went to the voting booth.\"\nThe non-binding primary is the only contest the Libertarian Party will hold before its nominating convention in May. California is also to hold a primary, but it is scheduled after the nomination. Ogle is to appear on the California ballot.\nRepublican focuses on Iran.\nRepublican presidential candidate Hugh Cort, a psychiatrist and President of the non-profit American Foundation for Counter-Terrorism Policy and Research, describes his campaign's status as \"wait-and-see\". In December, he participated in the Republican Party's lesser-known candidates forum, and was included on the ballot. He received a total of three votes.\nNevertheless, Cort's main area of concern is the in Iran, which garnered significant press in February. Iran, which claims it is enriching uranium for peaceful purposes, blocked International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors from monitoring a site suspected of containing nuclear weapons research. Increasing western sanctions against the country have resulted in threats from the government that it will cut off oil exports to Europe and/or close the strategic . This talk has affected the price of crude oil. Commentators have suggested that war is looming.\nCort, who has written a book entitled \"The American Hiroshima: Iran\u2019s Plan for a Nuclear Attack on the United States\", which he gave to Mitt Romney, believes Iran already has a nuclear weapon and that an attack on the United States is \"very likely to happen in the very near future.\" He tells \"Wikinews\" that if \"Iran does detonate some nuclear bombs in American cities, I would consider continuing my run for President, under the assumption that perhaps America would like to elect someone who knows something about counter-terrorism.\"\nHow should the president address the nuclear situation in Iran?\nHow did Mitt Romney react when you handed him your book?\nWhich of the presidential candidates is best equipped to handle the Iran situation?\nMore than one-dimensional?\nDemocratic presidential candidate is best known as an anti-abortion advocate. However, he says he is not the \"one-dimensional\" character portrayed in the press. He tells \"Wikinews\" that in addition to his activism, he has experience in theology, foreign policy, and music.\nTerry finished second in the in February and ranks above all primary challengers to President Barack Obama.

It's the latest development for a nation facing mounting economic diffuclties.\nEgypt's foreign reserves fell by over 50 percent last year to about 16 billion. Egypt has requested US$3.2 billion from the International Monetary Fund to bolster its reserves and prevent a devalation but that could take months.\nExperts say that Egypt's problem of attracting foreign investment and tourists, which are two sources that would increase reserves, has already caused the to lose 1 percent of its value and if the country doesn't solve the shortfall in foriegn currency, it could even lead to a further currency within the next two to three months.\nThe long-term solution is to restore tourism and foreign investments but both are suffering because of the continuing unrest.\nTourism.\n Egyptian tourism suffered this past year as a result of a revolution, a transition to an elected government, and continuing signs of unrest and instability.\nThe began on January 25 last year and President Hosni Mubarak resigned over two weeks later on February 11. The protests have continued as Egyptians grew uncomfortable with the military's control over the transition. At the start of this month, 79 people were killed at a soccer event in .\nTourism in Egypt accounted for US$12.5 billion in 2010 but fell 30 percent, or US$8.8 billion, in 2011, according to , Egypt's tourism minister. Tourism accounts for 11.6 percent of Egypt's GDP.\n Last week, two U.S. female tourists and their Egyptian guide were abducted in the Sinai peninsula by tribesmen and released shortly afterward.\nThe kidnapping took place in broad daylight on a busy road while the tourists travelled after a visit to . Masked tribesmen stopped their bus, abducted the tourists by gunpoint, and escaped into the mountains. Three other tourists of unknown nationalities were left on the bus. Local authorities organized a search which ended in negotiations with local Bedouin tribesmen. The Bedouin demanded the release of recently apprehended tribesmen, who had been detained for drug trafficking and robbery. The US hostages were released unharmed, Abdel Nour said.\nAs a location, Egypt boasts ancient , the , Biblical sites like , , and coastal resorts. Last year the number of tourists plunged from fifteen million people down to nine million, which is a 40 percent drop.\nThe low amount of tourism to Egypt has also affected tourism in other countries. Stas Misezhnikov, Israeli tourism minister, said that Israeli tourism is down because the flow of tourism from Egypt's resort is \"almost nonexistent right now.\"\nInvestment.\nEgypt's current investment climate is also severely hampered by the perception that the climate is not yet right for investment. \nMulyani Indrawati, managing director of the World Bank, said investors were not ready to get back into the markets of the countries until stability is restored but the situation has also been exacerbated by the precarious state of the regional and international economy.\nEgypt's domestic politics is threatening one of the country's largest stable sources of foreign investment. The United States' annual military aid to Egypt accounts for US$1.5 billion. U.S. politicians have threatened to withhold that aid package, however, because of an investigation into pro-democracy NGOs that involve 19 American citizens and more U.S. money. Senator said the Egyptian investigation is a \"dangerous game that risks damaging both Egypt's democratic prospects and the U.S.-Egyptian bilateral relationship.\"\n, who is the Egyptian minister who distributes Egypt's aid money, a former Mubarak loyalist who survived through the transition, and one of Egypt's most visible female politicians, claims the NGOs are meddling in her country's sovereignty. Both the Muslim parties who won the election and the generals in power are backing those hearings. Her argument that foreigners are meddling in Egypt also has a populist appeal.\nThe military government's slow transition is also stalling foreign investments. Khaled bin Mohamed al-Attiya, foreign minister of Qatar, said a few weeks ago his government is holding back from making US$10 billion in investments because power has not been transferred to an elected government. The other Middle Eastern countries that pledged investments, such as Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates are also waiting.\nThe Egyptian government announced this week that it was investigating Yasser el-Mallawany, an investment banker with based in Cairo, for allegedly paying soccer fans to riot at Port Said, a charge which el-Mallawany dismissed and attributed to gossip.\nMeanwhile, investors within Egypt are looking for other investment vehicles such as real estate as they fear holding cash in a period of devaluation.\nFlorence Eid, who is an expert on Middle Eastern economies at U.K. Arabia Monitor, said the situation throughout the Middle East could get worse. \"People are frustrated because the reasons that they revolted against to begin with, are still there,\" Eid said. \"Whoever said this was going to be smooth was naive.\"\nExternal links.\nEgyptian Pound (EGP) in US Dollar (USD)"}

He was convicted today.\nUka, a Kosovan who has lived in Germany since he was four, worked in 's mail room. He became attracted to Islamic radicalism in a matter of months and would later cite a video appearing to show US soldiers raping women in Afghanistan as his motive for the attack. The video was not genuine.\nUka approached a USAF bus at the airport, asking a serviceman for a cigarette. Upon learning the group was bound for Afghanistan he fatally shot the man in the head before boarding the bus with a cry of \" (God is Great). There, he opened fire upon more USAF airmen, killing a second and injuring two others. The remaining eleven passengers escaped injury when his 9mm pistol jammed. The team had been loading their bus in front of the airport during a trip that began in the United Kingdom.\nThe fatalities were Nicholas Alden, 25, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21. Cuddeback had been the driver. Edgar Veguilla received arm and jaw wounds while Kristoffer Schneider was left requiring reconstructive surgery for his face. Uka's weapon failed whilst pointed at a fifth man's head. Schneider has ongoing pain, blindness in one eye, a missing section of skull and a face rebuilt from titanium.

There was no drug or alcohol use involved, and no evidence Uka had been trained for the attack.\nThe killer described himself to the court as spending much of his time on computers, with few friends and a largely non-religious family background. He sat motionless with his eyes down and arms folded during the 70-minute verdict and sentencing hearing.\nUka had not joined any radical organisations and the defence claimed he was not a terrorist. Last year he blamed inaccurate propaganda for having influenced him and apologised, claiming not to understand his own actions. His defence lawyer, Michaela Roth, also sought to have his youth, admissions, and a troubled childhood considered.\nRoth had suggested sexual abuse when Uka was six had led to a return of trauma when he saw the falsified rape video.

A study found Scotland's suicide rate to be increasing away from neighbouring England, Russian press and politicians are examining the world's third-highest teen suicide rate, and new figures showed increasing Aboriginal children's suicides in Australia's Northern Territory.\n\"Until the highest authorities see suicide as a problem, our joint efforts will be unlikely to yield any results,\" Boris Polozhy of Moscow's Serbsky center said yesterday. Only fellow ex- nations Belarus and Kazakhstan have higher teen suicide rates than Russia, which is at around 20 per 100,000 nationally. , and nearby have rates of 120 and 77 per 100,000 respectively. Thursday saw national children's ombudsman Pavel Astakhov say 4,000 youths kill themselves each year.\nTop Health Ministry psychologist Zurab Kekelidze yesterday responded to expert calls for action, promising to \"very soon... start implementing\" a plan of action to tackle the issue. He said Russian schools, which are criticised for understaffing and perceived inattention to bullying, should teach psychology. \nKekelidze asked the to help the suicidal, and severely criticised popular online forums dedicated to suicide, where methods are compared. \"I have seen websites that offer a thousand ways of killing oneself,\" he claimed. Astakhov wanted schools to offer assistance via a social networking presence and tackle online bullying.\nThe overall national suicide rate is decreasing \u2014 down from 42 per 100,000 in 1995 to 23.5 two years ago. The high rate amongst teens is attributed to both school problems and violence at home. Recent high-profile cases include yesterday's death of a twelve-year-old who hung himself at home in , Siberia, and two fourteen-year-olds who jumped hand-in-hand to their ends from a building in , Moscow.\nResearchers from the Scottish cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, and Manchester in England, have been looking at data from 1960 to 2008. Although Scotland had the lower rate until 1968, has had the lower rate since. Both areas had increasing rates until the southern side started to fall in the '90s, and in recent years the gap has significantly increased. \nData was sorted by age, gender, and method; marked increases were seen among Scotsmen aged from 25 to 54 with hanging increasing in popularity. The female rate has remained largely static.\n\"This study adds to our understanding about patterns of suicide in Great Britain by producing sound evidence on divergences in long-term trends in Scotland compared to England and Wales,\" said Professor Stephen Platt, a lead researcher from 's Centre for Population Health Sciences. \"In a future companion paper we will suggest explanations for the persisting higher rate of suicide in Scotland.\" \nFellow joint lead researcher Roger Webb of the Centre for Suicide Prevention of said the high Scottish hanging rate was \"of particular concern as hanging has high case-fatality and is difficult to prevent, except within institutional settings.\" He noted \"a public information campaign about hanging\" could be one way of reducing the rate. Paid for by the Scottish taxpayer, the results appeared in the \".\nIn an incident with parallels to the recent Moscow deaths, in 2009 Scottish and British media publicised a high-profile case in which two teenagers leap together from the , a famed suicide spot over the where an estimated fifteen people kill themselves each year.\nThis week also saw Howard Bath, Children's Commissioner for Australia's Northern Territory, suggest the area had the highest proportion of Aborignal girl suicides in the West. There has been a significant increase since an emergency intervention five years ago in response to a report titled \" which documented widespread sexual abuse of Northern Territory children and failures by authorities to adequately respond.\nA national government-backed Northern Territory suicide inquiry is ongoing and due to report next month. The inquiry has heard clusters of deaths occurred around and , , and the vicinity of . The had a very high rate from 2000 to 2005, but has now not had a suicide for a year.\nFemale suicide rates have greatly increased to account for 40% of Northern Territory suicides amongst those aged less than eighteen. \"We now have a situation in the territory where there are almost as many female as male suicides,\" said Bath. Lack of information is a problem; the all-party inquiry has heard evidence of much under-reporting and poor data collection. The Menzies School of Health's Gary Robinson called for a Queensland-style register of suicides.\nRobinson suggests -induced to be a contributing factor but laments \"The big problem is nobody keeps any data. Everything is based on impressions.\" He also suggested bullying, as in Russia, is a problem while Bath notes violence against women may also take a role. \"Aboriginal women are being hospitalised for assault at 80 times the rate of other women... Exposure to violence greatly increases the risk of a person taking their life.\" He also notes \"I am concerned, as the commissioner, about children who are frequently exposed to violence in the home or in the immediate family.\"\nAs with Scotland, hanging is a popular choice. \"The method chosen is usually hanging and it is a particularly lethal method, far more than an overdose,\" said Bath. New South Wales, with the nation's largest indigenous population, has a suicide rate of one per 100,000 but the Northern Territory rate is over 30 per 100,000."}

Officers have visited the ship, which Ajithkumar says will have to remain where it is during the investigation.\nItalian authorities in India are attempting dialogue on behalf of the crew, but \"Till further orders from the ministry we will not engage in any talks,\" said advocate VJ Mathews, who is working with the Italians. The letter to the captain also went to the Italian foreign ministry, and the Italian ambassador has been summoned over the incident. Indian defence minister A.K. Antony called events \"very serious\" and \"unfortunate\", promising action would be taken.\nChandrashekhar described the event thus: \"The fishermen did not fire at the ship. They couldn't have been mistaken for pirates. The Indian trawler was 100m from the ship. The trawler wanted the ship to pass.\" Nine other crew were sleeping on the fishing boat. The state has approved 500,000 (10,125; 6,450) for each dead man's family.\nThe Italians say they fired warning shots before targeting the trawler they misidentified as a pirate boat. Two bullets have been recovered from the smaller vessel, which one local official said had no weapons aboard."}

Civilians and journalists are amongst the dead, and \"Wikinews\" spoke to a local citizen journalist, attracting attention both from the world's media and from the . According to \"Wikinews\"' source, much of Homs is without water, and a city facing starvation.\nSyrian forces began a ground assault on Homs February 4, using troops, and bombarding the city with tanks and . To this day, the bombardment continues. Soldiers frequently clash with anti-government protesters, and 'freedom fighters' of the in violent, often deadly encounters. In the Baba Amr district of the city, \"Omar\" [\"for his safety, we only use his first name, Ed.\"], a citizen journalist with the Homs Media Center, created an account on the website where users can stream live footage from PCs or mobile phones. He then pointed a camera out of his home, overlooking the city, and began broadcasting footage live on the Internet.\nThe violent, often deadly, events following may have, indirectly, resulted from this action. Journalists discussed in this article put their lives in jeopardy to give the world a record of events; in some cases, dying doing so. But, their deaths may not have been accidental; evidence suggests possible intentional targeting by Syrian government forces.\nOmar usually began broadcasting just before sunrise. At 5:18 a.m. () in Homs on February 9, Omar started his live broadcast; the sky still dark, with only a few lights flickering around the area. Sporadic gun and rocket fire between Syrian forces and the audible on the live feed. By sunrise, gun battles had ceased, the city silent except for the occasional rooster welcoming the morning sun. As daylight broke tanks inside the city, and artillery on its outskirts, began shelling buildings and other targets. Throughout the morning, rocket fire and tank shelling could be heard getting closer and closer to Omar's position.\nAt approximately 07:40 EET, nearly two-and-a-half hours into the broadcast, the camera's microphone records the audio of the brief, but distinct, 'whistle' of a rocket or shell as it sails through the air. It strikes close to the camera's position, causing it to wobble an shake, nearly tipping over; smoke obscures the camera's view, debris falling onto it whilst sounds of parts of nearby buildings collapsing are heard.\nThe camera continues to film, apparently undamaged. Omar's house isn't so lucky, suffering a direct hit from a rocket. Out of the camera's view, people inside the house begin to scream. Less than two minutes later, a second rocket strikes the house just above and behind the camera's position; again, causing it to shake. The sun casts the rising smoke's shadow on the house next door as more debris hits the camera. Further screams are heard as rubble collapses around people inside. Those inside, running and shouting, now make up most of the broadcast audio; some begin to pray, whilst others bring round a car to carry out the injured or dead. Moments later another rocket is fired, residents screaming warnings to each other of another possible incoming strike. An explosion is heard, and smoke can be seen rising, center-right of the camera shot, from the rocket striking nearby.\nA few minutes later, two men are seen coming out onto their balcony and looking in the direction of the house that was just hit. They talk, looking and pointing in the direction of Omar's house, with the sound of gunfire in the area. At 07:50, they go back inside and out of sight.\nThree minutes later a rocket is fired, striking that house, exactly where the two men were standing. It is unknown if they were killed or injured in the attack, but according to Omar the attacks around his home left five dead, three women and two men; Omar himself survives unscathed.\nDespite the deaths in the February 9 attack, Omar kept his camera rolling whenever awake; but, that was about to change.\nFebruary 15 was a relatively quiet morning but, as sunrise gave way to the daylight, rockets began hitting targets in the city for the eleventh consecutive day. Shortly before 08:00 EET, a small plume of black smoke appears, left side of the live broadcast, an oil pipeline having sustained its first direct hit. Moments later, a second strike on the pipeline is in-shot, also to the left of the camera's view. The acrid smoke from this strike quickly begins to grow.\nShortly after the second hit on the pipeline Omar enters the room, moving the camera to show both strikes. Twin plumes of thick black smoke are now visible rising in the distance. Omar states the oil pipeline sustained damage from an attack by Syrian military aircraft. From a satellite photo taken after the bombing, the pipeline is seen near a densely populated area of the city, with farmland lying to the west. The smoke from the pipeline fire blankets nearly all of the populated area, to the east, in range of the photo.\nAfter repositioning the camera, Omar decided to leave his house to undertake some field work; a fortuitous move as Omar stated on his stream, \"after we left the house\" a rocket made a direct hit on it, leaving a hole in one of the sides. There were no injuries in the attack, the building being unoccupied at the time.\nWith sunset closing in and the pipeline still ablaze, Omar turned off his camera, not just for the night \u2014 indefinitely. Omar now believes he is in too much danger to broadcast further, tweeting: \"[I] really am confused [...] am worried to turn the live camera on. It's become very dangerous.\" Omar has since left his home. \nCrucial as some of the live footage may be at getting pictures of bloodshed inside Syria out; for now, much of the output which ended up hosted on Bambuser has dried up. On February 17, the Syrian government blocked access to the website and its mobile phone application. Despite government action, some isolated examples of live footage continue making their way out of Syria, mainly from mobile phones. \nBambuser speculate that Syrian authorities' move to block access may be a result of Omar's live footage showing the oil pipeline fire on Feburary 15. That footage was rebroadcast on several major news networks, including CNN, , and .\n\"We believe this footage was the trigger for the Syrian government to block access to bambuser.com and disable the possibility to broadcast live video with mobile phones on Syrian 3G,\" said a Bambuser statement on their website. Bambuser has been blocked previously in other countries. Access to the site was blocked by in January 2011, during their revolution. blocked the site six months ago, and it remains blocked to this day.\nBambuser's statement continues: \"Not only have we helped them get their message out, but they also say it means much in terms of morale for everyone in this situation. They [The Syrian people] know the world is watching, sharing and it gives them hope. No matter where in the world there is unrest, we at Bambuser always do our best to support and help observers\". \nOmar is not alone in being at-risk; on February 18 a funeral for three men, shot and killed by Syrian forces during an anti-government protest the prior day, was being held in the central district of .\nOver fifteen thousand people, including women and children, filled the streets paying their respects. After a prayer, during which mourners remained completely silent, the procession turned into a mass-protest. With mourners-turned-protesters marching down the streets, the sky over Damascus darkened and snow began falling. With the change of weather appearing to embolden the protesters, their chants grew louder.\nShortly thereafter, Syrian forces surrounded the front of the march, and opening fire with live rounds and tear gas. Panicked people quickly scattered, turning the once-peaceful march into a stampede. At least one was shot and killed. Dozens of others sustained injuries. This was the first time Syrian forces opened fire on protesters in central Mezzeh.\nThose people are just a small fraction of those who have been killed or injured since the uprisings began. It is estimated that from five thousand to upwards of seven thousand people have been killed since January of last year. As a result, on February 20, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) announced it was attempting to negotiate a cease fire by all parties \"to facilitate swift Syrian Arab Red Crescent and ICRC access to the people in need.\"\nThe ICRC wants troops to halt their attacks in cities that have seen the most fighting in order to deliver care packages. Bijan Farnoudi, a spokesman for the Red Cross, said discussions include \"several possibilities\" in which the packages can be delivered. Though the organization has been delivering food and supplies to as many cities and citizens as possible, heavy fighting in areas such as the Baba Amr district of Homs has made it increasingly difficult for aid to be delivered. Even while the Red Cross worked to negotiate a cease fire, reports out of Homs on February 20 said Syrian forces were amassing troops and tanks outside the city in preparation for an all-out ground invasion. According to Omar, the shellings continued, but on February 24, the Red Cross announced it was allowed to begin evacuating injured women and children from the city.\nOn February 21, a member of the Homs Media Center was killed by a rocket as Syrian forces continued their bombardment of the city for an eighteenth straight day. Rami al-Sayed was reported to have been severely injured by a rocket while attempting to evacuate individuals to a makeshift hospital, during what activists call the worst day of bombardment since Syrian forces began their attack on the city on February 4. According to Bambuser, he and three others were inside a car when it was hit by a mortar, immediately killing the others. Sayed bled to death at the hospital.\nSayed was a videographer \"crucial in getting the truth out through his videos posted on the Internet. We will really miss him, especially the medical team who relied on him to document all the civilian injuries and deaths on video,\" said Omar in an interview with . Sayed also was one of the men affiliated with the account 'syriapioneer' on Bambuser. Like Omar, he would broadcast live footage of the events on the ground in Homs. Bambuser published the last known message sent out to friends and family: \"Babaamr is facing a genocide right now. I will never forgive you for your silence. You all have just give us your words but we need actions. However our hearts will always be with those who risk their life for our freedom. ... In a few hours there will be NO place called BabaAmr and I expect this will be my last message and no one will forgive you who talked but didn't act.\" Sayed, 26, had a daughter of 18 months. In December, a citizen-journalist cousin of Sayed's, Basil al-Sayed, was also killed. In a statement to \"\" Omar described Sayed as \"my best friend\" and they both have worked as citizen journalists for about \"10 months\", around the beginning of the uprisings. \nThe killings didn't end there. Another two journalists were killed February 22, whilst at the Homs Media Center. , a journalist, and award winning photographer , were killed when rockets hit the center. At least two others were injured in the attack, French journalist Edith Bouvier and photographer Paul Conroy.\nThe Syrian government denies involvement, saying their deaths were \"absolutely not\" caused \"by Syrian armies.\" The following day Bouvier made a video plea to Syrian forces that she be allowed to leave Homs to seek medical attention. Conroy stated, despite leg wounds, he was \"OK.\"\nOmar was in a conversation with a friend at the media center when the attack took place. He recorded the call's audio using a web camera and posted the video on ; sounds of explosions and possible gunfire can be heard throughout. Reports strongly suggest the media center attack was deliberate; radio communications between Syrian government forces indicate orders to attack the building \u2014 whilst making it appear individuals died caught in a gun battle with terrorists. \nIt is because of situations such as that on February 16, the (UN GA) voted, \"[...] overwhelmingly to call on both the government and allied forces and armed groups to stop all violence or reprisals immediately.\" The UN GA press release expressed grave concern at the Syria's deteriorating situation and, \"[...] condemned a raft of violations carried out by the authorities, such as the use of force against civilians, the killing and persecution of protesters and journalists, and sexual violence and ill-treatment, including against children.\"\nCalling on Syria to abide obligations under international law, the UN GA \"[...] demanded that the Government, in line with the 2 November 2011 Action Plan of the League of Arab States, and its decisions of 22 January and 12 February 2012, without delay, stop all violence and protect its people, release all those detained during the unrest, withdraw all armed forces from cities and towns, guarantee peaceful demonstrations and allow unhindered access for Arab League monitors and international media.\"\n137 nations voted for the General Assembly's resolution, twelve opposed and 17 abstained. As with many UN GA resolutions, the findings and conclusions are non-binding.\nEarlier, on February 4, the failed to pass resolution S/2012/77, supporting actions pursuing peace in Syria. This resolution was vetoed by Security Council members and . \nThe Arab League's goal, according to their report on Syria, \"is to protect Syrian citizens through the commitment of the Syrian government to stop acts of violence, release detainees and withdraw all military presence from cities like Homs, and an end to violence in Syria.\" The League noted Homs, Dera\u2018a, Idlib, and Hama as the cities primarily affected by such incidents. The report claims all such incidents were caused by \"armed groups\" or \"entities not mentioned in the protocol [report].\"\nDespite the League's claim, live footage broadcast more than a month after the report was filed suggests the opposite as tanks continued to bombard cities like Homs. The League, in their report, go on to say Syrians \"believe the crisis should be resolved peacefully through Arab mediation alone, without international intervention. Doing so would allow them to live in peace and complete the reform process and bring about the change they desire.\" \nOmar disagrees with the League's conclusion that Syrians do not want international intervention. He believes if \"the world\" doesn't act soon, many more will die from starvation. Medical supplies have not been making their way to makeshift hospitals and food is scarce. Much of the city is without water and Syrian forces continue their assault on the city. In a statement to \"Wikinews\" on Wednesday, Omar said \"if they stay like this [the world] just watching us, people will die not because of the shelling, they will die because of starvation. We are surrounded. There is no food, no water and no medical supplies. If the world doesn't do anything we will die from starvation. In the coming days I can see a massacre from starving.\""}

Before he died, Breitbart had claimed to possess a video of President Barack Obama that would change the course of the election. The video, which was released shortly after Breitbart's death, showed Obama as a law student at speaking in favor of , a controversial professor who had accused the American system of being racist.

He also won the endorsements of former Florida , of Florida, and of Wisconsin. Despite the successes, the specter of a brokered convention remained as Romney failed to win enough delegates to secure the nomination. \nRomney's closest rival, former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, won Kansas, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and three of the Super Tuesday states including North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Tennessee. However, he suffered some missteps that cost his campaign: he called for English to be adopted as the official language in Puerto Rico as a condition of , and later remarked that if Romney won the nomination and moved to the political center, \"we might as well stay with what we have instead of taking a risk of what may be the candidate for the future.\" Santorum was alluding to comments from a Romney adviser that compared the campaign to an Etch A Sketch in that \"[we] shake it up and we start all over again\" for the general election. However, Santorum's comments were interpreted as a suggestion that voters should favor the Democrat Obama over Romney, which Santorum later denied.\nMeanwhile, former Newt Gingrich and Congressman Ron Paul continued their campaigns for the GOP nomination. Paul finished second in Washington, North Dakota, Vermont, and Virginia, and won the popular vote, but not the majority of delegates, in the Virgin Islands. Gingrich focused his energies on the southern states. He won his home state of Georgia on Super Tuesday, and came in second place in Alabama and Mississippi. Most notably during March, Gingrich proclaimed he could reduce in the United States to $2.50 a gallon through increased . President Obama used this statement to attack the GOP, arguing that they were playing political games. On energy, Obama called for further development of . Polls showed that high energy prices were negatively affecting his popularity.\nAdditionally, the Obama campaign attacked the GOP for the February of radio personality that referred to student as a \"slut\" and \"prostitute\" after she testified about coverage before a congressional hearing. The campaign alleged that the GOP was waging a \"war on women\" for its opposition to the that contraceptives be included on the insurance plans of organizations regardless of their religious views.\nForeign affairs and missile defense also became an election topic after an open-microphone during a forum in South Korea captured President Obama tell Russian , \"[O]n all these issues, but particularly missile defense... This is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility.\" Medvedev replied that he would \"transmit this information to \". Romney criticized the comments, arguing \"I think it\u2019s very alarming for the President of the United States to suggest to Russia that he has a different agenda that he\u2019s going to work out with the Russians after the elections\". He then labeled Russia as \"without question, our number one geopolitical foe.\" In response, Medvedev referenced the and advised the Romney campaign \"to check their watches from time to time: it is 2012, not the mid-1970s.\"\nMight the GOP VP nominee come from Puerto Rico?\nAs Republican frontrunner Mitt Romney campaigned in Puerto Rico ahead of that territory's March 18 , at his side was Puerto Rican . Fortu\u00f1o had endorsed Romney for president, and has received mention as a potential vice presidential nominee. Commentators argue his presence on a ticket could draw Hispanic support to the GOP.\nFortu\u00f1o was as the first Republican governor in the territory since 1969. As governor, he sought government cuts and low corporate and individual tax rates in an attempt to improve economic conditions. \"\" referred to his governorship as the \"Puerto Rico Miracle\" and labeled Fortu\u00f1o a \"\" whose \"example should be followed in the United States\".

A \"\" editorial labeled Fortu\u00f1o a \"fine choice for Vice President\" and GOP operative also endorsed the idea, saying the selection of Fortu\u00f1o would \"bring charisma, star power and excitement to the campaign.\" \nSuch speculation heightened as the 2012 presidential race shifted to Puerto Rico in March. Fortu\u00f1o campaigned with Romney, leading both and to label him as a potential running mate. Fortu\u00f1o did not comment much on the speculation, but preferred to discuss Romney, saying he believed that as president, Romney would push for Puerto Rican statehood. With Fortu\u00f1o's assistance, Romney was able to win the Puerto Rican contest with 83 percent of the vote. In his victory speech, Romney commented, \"I intend to become our nominee and I intend to get Latino voters to vote for a Republican.\" According to Fortu\u00f1o himself, one way to accomplish this would be to select an Hispanic as a running mate.\nPolitical consultant Dan Judy of North Star Opinion Research agrees. He tells \"Wikinews\", \"I don't think there's any one silver bullet that will bring a majority Hispanic voters to the Republican side, but I think the selection of Governor Fortuno would help, particularly among Puerto Rican voters living on the mainland.\" According to a Fox News poll from March, Romney receives only 14 percent of the Hispanic vote in a matchup with President Obama, and Judy says that Puerto Ricans vote Democratic at an even higher rate than other Hispanic nationalities. He explains, \"a Puerto Rican on the ticket would at least cause them to take a closer look at the GOP candidate.\"\nHowever, Judy warns that Fortu\u00f1o's eligibility may be questioned since Puerto Rico is not a state. Because of this, he says more attention is given to other Hispanic GOP politicians such as Nevada , New Mexico and Senator Marco Rubio.

However, the Democratic Party has decided to remove the delegates from Terry because of his failure to file a delegate slate and for not being a \"bona fide\" Democratic presidential candidate. Former U.S. Senate nominee , who also qualified for delegates in the primary after winning over 15 percent in some congressional districts, was similarly stripped for failing to file. \nIn a letter to Terry, the Oklahoma Democratic Party detailed its decision, describing a \"bona fide\" presidential candidate as a \"Democrat whose record of public service, accomplishment, public writings and/or public statements affirmatively demonstrates that he or she is faithful to the interests, welfare, and success of the Democratic Party of the United States and will participate in the Convention in good faith.\" It concludes that Terry did not fit this description because he was recently a member of the Republican Party.\nAt the March 24 , attorney John Wolfe, Jr. qualified for delegates after receiving over 15 percent in some congressional districts of the state. It is not known at this time whether these delegates will be seated at the Democratic National Convention in August, or if he will be subject to the same decision as Terry and Rogers. \n\"Wikinews\" contacted Wolfe and fellow Democratic Party candidates Bob Ely and Darcy Richardson to ask whether they were concerned the Democratic Party leadership would strip delegates from them if they qualified, and award them to President Obama. All three candidates appeared on the Louisiana primary ballot and will appear with Obama on the Texas ballot in May. Only Ely and Richardson appeared with Obama, Terry, and Rogers on the Oklahoma ballot.\nParty removes presidential nominee.\nThe membership of the (BTP) removed as the party's presidential nominee after it was discovered that she misrepresented herself as a graduate and member of the Board of Trustees of . Briscoe is actually just a student at the school. \nFollowing her nomination, Briscoe spoke with \"Wikinews\" and said she would \"probably be able to appear on [the ballots of] 14 to 15 states throughout the country\". After the removal, she has not responded to inquiries about the future of her campaign. \"Wikinews\" was able to contact parliamentary activist and (LP) presidential candidate James Ogle, who is listed as Briscoe's running mate on her website. As reported last month, Ogle won a majority of the votes over uncommitted at the Missouri Libertarian presidential primary. He says he is in the process of securing a spot for himself and Briscoe as a write-in ticket on the Texas general election ballot. Ogle also plans to be the running mate for five other women candidates including comedienne of the .\nAs for the BTP, a new nominee is expected to be announced shortly. Chairman Darryl Perry says the party may be approaching \"the brink of death\" but he remains optimistic. Though he makes no firm predictions about ballot access, Perry expects \"voters in more than a dozen States\" to be able to vote for the BTP nominee, including through write-in eligibility. He argues that the BTP can move beyond the setback and become a major third party if members increase their activity and \"the LP allows itself to be taken over by those who would redefine 'libertarian'.\"\nThe BTP was founded in 2006 as an alternative to the LP. According to its platform, it \"supports reducing the size, scope and power of government at all levels and on all issues, and opposes increasing the size, scope and power of government at any level, for any purpose.\" In 2008, the party nominated boxing manager , who appeared on three state ballots and won a total of 2,422 votes."}

Speaking on behalf of the government, Alfred Mutua stated the workers were dismissed \"illegally striking\" and \"[defying] the directive ... to report back to work\", which he called \"unethical\". The government asks that \"[a]ll qualified health professionals, who are unemployed and/or retired have been advised to report to their nearest health facility for interviews and deployment\", Mutua stated.\nThe workers, who had been on strike for four days, were wishing to have improvements made to their wages, working conditions, and allowances. The strikes have caused a significant number of Kenyan hospitals to cease operations. According to Kenya Health Professionals Society spokesperson Alex Orina, the average monthly wage plus allowances for health workers in Kenya is 25,000 (193, 302 or 230) approximately.

Like Fluke, Senator Shaheen pointed out the need not to silence the voices of women in the public government debate about women\u2019s health care: \u201cTime and time again, women have been silenced in this discussion, a discussion about our own very personal health care decisions.\u201d Senator Shaheen concluded her remarks with an explanation as to why she believes women should have significant representation in discussions about their health care: \u201cWomen deserve a voice in this debate because, after all, in the end this is about our health and it is about a health care decision that is between women, their families, their doctors, and their own faith.\u201d\nPresident Barack Obama called Fluke on March 2 to express his support for her courage to speak out on issues of women\u2019s health. In his first press conference of 2012 on March 6, he discussed his reasons for deciding to call Fluke. \nThe President cited his personal thoughts about his own two daughters: \u201cAnd the reason I called Ms. Fluke is because I thought about [Obama's daughters], and one of the things I want them to do as they get older is to engage in issues they care about, even ones I may not agree with them on. I want them to be able to speak their mind in a civil and thoughtful way. And I don't want them attacked or called horrible names because they're being good citizens.\u201d\nPresident Obama went on to state that Fluke served as a positive role model for citizen participation in democracy and society: \u201cAnd I wanted Sandra to know that I thought her parents should be proud of her, and that we want to send a message to all our young people that being part of a democracy involves argument and disagreements and debate, and we want you to be engaged, and there's a way to do it that doesn't involve you being demeaned and insulted, particularly when you\u2019re a private citizen.\u201d"}

Japan brought five pitchers to Canberra for their Australian tour. Since the last Olympics, Japan has been in a rebuilding period. The side is young and many of their best players have not had much international experience. One of their best pitchers is only nineteen years old.\nThe ACT side included Australian national team members Aimee Murch and Clare Warwick; Olympic bronze medalist ; Victorian state team representative, national team member and Olympic bronze medalist ; and Clare Currie, who narrowly missed the cut for the national team.\nDe Blaes started the top of the first with a hit. She ended the inning stranded on base. Murch was pitching for the ACT to start the bottom of the first. Number 15 for Japan opened the inning with a single, and was advanced to third on another single. She was tagged out after trying to score a run after her teammate hit a pop up caught by the ACT's centre fielder. Number 6 hit a double during this inning, scoring Japan's only run. \nThe top of the second saw ACT players 1, 5 and 3 tagged out after hits to the infield. The bottom of the second saw number 13 out on a foul ball caught on the fly by the ACT's third baseman, and number 11 and 24 out on balls hit into and caught by the ACT's centre fielder. \nThe top of third inning saw numbers 24 and 21 ground out. De Blaes ended the inning by striking out. The bottom of the third saw Japan's first batter ground out, number 8 getting a single on an infield hit, another playing getting an out, and the inning ending with number 11 hitting an infield ground out.\nThe rest of the game followed much the same pattern. Two players, an ACT player and a Japanese, were struck by balls and required trainers to look at them. Smethurst came in and pitched a few innings in relief. Between the fifth and sixth innings, there was a small delay in the game when a dog named Streaker, owned by player Adam Folkard, ran onto the the infield. \nThe game ended 1\u20130.

They are both named to the current men's national team, which has roughly thirty players, and believe they are likely to survive the December cut down to eighteen players who will represent Australia at next year's World Championship in , New Zealand.\nThe World Championship is one of the two most prestigious available to male softball players. The other is the , an event Folkard and Norton have both competed at.\nAs national team representatives, there are a lot of expectations for them. In Australia, there is almost no financial support for the men's game so they must cover most of their own costs, including travel to and from international competitions. According to Folkard's father, these costs can be prohibitive. In one year, when Folkard was a representative on the men's U18, U23 and Open team, it cost 15,000 for travel and other expenses just for Folkard. When costs for bringing family members such as Folkard's sisters to major international tournaments, the costs were even higher. Folkard, his father and Norton all joked this cost his father an investment property to allow Folkard to continue to compete at the highest level. Both Folkard and Norton currently work as tradesmen to support softball playing.\nBeyond money, the national team requires players to be actively involved in wider softball community. Players must represent a club at the club championships in Brisbane if they want to retain a spot in the squad. Folkard plays for a Western Australian club and Norton plays for a Sydney based club, driving down from Canberra to play every Sunday during the season.\nFolkard and Norton have both played softball at the highest level in the United States, where the men's game is not yet fully professionalized but still presents more opportunities for players than are available at home. For several years, Folkard has gone to the United States for three-month stints, playing for teams in Chicago, Pennsylvania, and New York. One side he played was sponsored by Ernst and Young. Folkard currently plays for a Canadian side and has been trying to convince Norton, whom he has grown up playing softball with, to join him like Norton has done one previous season. According to Folkard, playing with a North American club has certain advantages. The clubs pay for his travel to and from Australia, and pay for Championship rings. When asked how North American clubs sign Australian players, he said they follow men's softball in Australia and call up players to offer contracts. Australian men's players gain additional exposure to potential clubs when they compete, with some sides approaching them during the North American season and seeking to contract them for the following season.\nBoth men would love the opportunity to play softball in the Olympics, but believe such an opportunity is unlikely. According to them, softball at the Olympics is a women's game intrinsically linked to men's baseball, and men's softball is unlikely to ever be considered on the programme as a result.\nFolkard and Norton both play for the same club in the ACT territory club competition. Their team has secured a grand final berth for the match in ten days. They are waiting to find out who they will play against based on a match this weekend. Both have previously won this competition."}

Planemaker now faces legal action from his widow Anna, which they vow to contest.\nThe report identified three separate problems with the ring handle to activate emergency oxygen. The first was that pulling the ring could require intense effort, the second that it was possible to drop the ring between seats, and the third that pilots in cold-weather gear could struggle to grasp it. \nNow new handles have been designed in Arizona and the Air Force will place them on all of the 143 million aircraft.

This makes breathing through the jet's mask difficult. The Air Force say he should have activated his emergency oxygen but the accident report and lawsuit question his ability to do so. The report notes he was conscious and fighting to keep his jet airbourne up until impact.\nDocuments filed with a court in Illinois claim the handle's position is \"in an area impossible for a pilot to reach while he or she maneuvered the sophisticated aircraft at speeds exceeding the speed of sound and while he or she experienced forces many times the force of gravity.\"\nThe fatal accident is not the only such problem to beset the F-22, which despite being billed by the Air Force as their most advanced fighter has never been deployed to combat since coming into service seven years ago.

The advert promoted various perks for the event, including an in-house DJ, cocktails, and access to women: women specifically there to serve beer to attendees. As soon as the ad was posted to , many on Twitter expressed concern. Over 3,000 tweets later, the advert was deemed sexist by many and Twitter users both condemned Sqoot and contacted the sponsors of the event. The ad, which Alex Williams of SiliconANGLE described as \"bizarre\" and \"misogynist,\" was quietly changed on Eventbrite by Sqoot, removing the mention of women as beer peddlers. \nIn a matter of hours, four sponsors had pulled out from the Boston event: CloudMine, Apigee, , and . Shortly thereafter, Sqoot offered two apologies: a brief apology which was then followed by a more detailed apology stating that they desired to have a \"good party\" that was not a standard hackathon experience of pizza and keynote speakers. Sqoot stated that they \"aimed to call attention to the male-dominated tech world through humor and intended to be inclusive, the gravity of our wording was just the opposite. Our words completely undermined our intentions and went further to harm the world we're trying to have a positive impact on.\" Other sponsors such as and Simple Relevance remained as sponsors. \nShanley Kane, director of product management at , supported the sponsor withdrawal and didn't just consider the advertisement sexist, but also by ostracizing gay men by promoting a seemingly \"straight\" agenda for the event. Kane also believed that Sqoot had the \"false assumption that women would not attend the event at all,\" by promoting it with a male targeted spin. In an industry that is dominated by men, it can be assumed that more men would attend the hackathon than women, but, the advertisement ostracized women even more from attending. And this wasn't Sqoot's first foray into straight male targeted marketing. Blog posts like \"Sqoot Makes You Yelp!\" featuring the Yelp logo on a woman's backside and \"Sqoot Goes Topless\" featuring an image of a topless woman, are meant to promote the opening of Yelp's API and company transparency. \nAlex Williams believes that the Sqoot situation shows that sexism within the tech industry is broad and growing. \"Women are marginalized and treated more as objects than as colleagues. The trend is a disturbing one and poses a serious threat to the health and diversity of the tech sector.\" Techli's Kathryn Hough chocked it up to immaturity, \"Someone needs to tell young founders that frat house behavior is not acceptable in the business world.

When it comes to the criticism fielded by the public towards businesses regarding sexist content, fellow Ada Initiative board member and database analyst Selena Deckelmann agrees that businesses need to step up to the challenge and respond appropriately. \"...companies need to develop the skills necessary to respond with grace and understanding, even when under intense, negative scrutiny. Silencing, gas-lighting and ignoring the messenger tactics no longer work when a social network quickly spreads information, and occasionally, outrage.\"\nIs there a future for Sqoot? Mike Maney believes Sqoot can recover. Maney, head of influencer management for Alcatel-Lucent, acknowledges that Sqoot will have a long way to go to regain their credibility amongst the tech industry and the clientele they serve, \"But, the work they'll have to do to undo the self-inflicted damage [...] is going to require a massive effort.\" "}

On Saturday, , Minister of Defense for the Republic of Congo, released a slightly lower death toll of 282. There was no explanation for discrepancies between the government's and the relief organization's figures as the ICRC's previous statement was already higher than Moussa's figure. Moussa said the death count, however, is expected to rise higher as the relief operations continue.\nMetraux also reported 75 children were still missing. The international organization has had success reuniting 42 children with their families in the aftermath and locating 23 missing children since. \nAlso, the has confirmed around 10 cases of cholera, which was supported by Alexis Elira Dokekias, the nation's director general of health.\nAlready in the first month of the operation, the munitions clearing teams have disposed of 16 tons of ordinance.\nThe expects the relief operation to last three more months.\nThe Brazzaville blast.\nTo put the Brazzaville blast into perspective, the number of people killed by the depot explosion this month is almost 100 times the average number of people killed in explosive incidents, based on figures presented by Landmine Action and Medact of explosions and deaths from around the world. The average death per explosive incident was reported by Landmine Action to be 3.3 people (see infographic).\nThe blast on March 4, 2012, was actually three separate explosions that were caused by an electrical short circuit at the depot. The blast injured 2,500, made 14,000 homeless, and disrupted education for 20,000 students. The explosion collapsed whole buildings nearby, including a church; contaminated the area within 1 km; and destroyed windows as far away as 4 km. The force of the explosion could be felt in neighboring . And, most dangerous for people now, the blast spread live munitions over a perimeter that spans 6 km. The Talanga\u00ef Hospital, one of Brazzaville's medical centers, was the most critical site affected. A portion of the hospital was destroyed and unexploded ordinances were spread over the premises. \nBrazzaville is the capital of the Republic of the Congo. According to the US State Department, 70 percent of the country's population lives in Brazzaville. It is the largest city there with a population of over 1.2 million, according to the CIA World Factbook. Nearly one third of the population there lives near the affected sections of the city, including Talanga\u00ef, Ouenz\u00e9, Moungali and Mfilou which were close to the depot located in the Mpila district.\nThe storage of arms in city centers is more common in Africa. In an interview with Wikinews, Dr. Kelechi Kalu, who is the director of the Center for African Studies at Ohio State University, said the orgins of the practice go back to the Cold War when the United States and the Soviet Union would arm opposite sides and would locate the arms so that the forces they supported could have access to them. After the Cold War, however, the practice was continued by governing institutions. \"The institutional structure that is supposed to handle explosives such as this and dispose of them in order to keep people safe are not as developed as people would expect.\" Kalu referred to another in January 27, 2002, in , that killed over 1000 people.\nThe 2009 report from Landmine Action said casualities as a result of explosives happens regularly around the world and the number of incidents spreads globally within a fairly short period of time \u2014 six months of data were studied. The report said the worst cases with high death rates occurred when explosive violence took place in urban settings, like the blast from the arms depot located in the highly populated area of Brazzaville. \nMoreover, the Landmine Action study reported that civilians, especially women and children, fared worse from these blasts. Congolese citizen Ir\u00e8ne Ithos, 44, and a mother of three, told IRIN News that the blast was unprecedented in her lifetime. It is one of the Republic of the Congo's worst catastrophes since its civil war was fought between 1997 and 1999. The depot itself was a holdover from the civil war era.\nThe relief operation.\nDealing with the unexploded munitions is urgent. \"The main thing now is to clear those areas as quickly as possible so that the people who live or work there and want to go back can do so without danger,\" said Metraux. \nThe Congolese army has fenced off the 1km area around the depot so that the site can be decontaminated. The is trying to dispose of the live munitions so that the Brazzaville residents can leave the camps and return to their homes. The organizations involved in ordinance disposal also include the British , a contingent from , and the ICRC. With so much ordinance underneath the ruins, the Congolese Red Cross is playing an important role in warning residents to call for assistance if they see ammunition. \nEarly on the Congolese Red Cross, as the area's first responders, provided first aid, transported crush victims from the fallen buildings and burn victims to the military and university hospitals, and provided blankets and water, said Christian Sedar Ndinga, president the country's organization. The Congolese Red Cross mobilized 200 volunteers in response to the crisis. \nWhile the relief agencies working with the Congolese have alleviated some needs, the effort still has holes to fill. Six sites have been established to relieve the homeless, but the camps do not have enough tents. One of those sites is the Sacred Heart Cathedral and it has 20 tents that were set up by the French army, but those are not enough, and during rains, even when the church is opened, not all people can be sheltered. The Nkombo Market is the other large relief site; it is a covered market converted into a shelter. The sites, however, have allowed to vaccinate 2,500 children from measles and the medical staff there has reported some malnutrition cases."}

The long bow class archers were competing for national honors because they are not eligible to participate at World Championships.\nTwenty-four targets were used for the competition with enough archers in groups of three to four to cover almost all of them at any one time.\nEliza Banard, Trudy Scott, Leanne Strahan from Victoria and Frances Atkins from the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) were some of the day's female competitors looking to qualify for the World Championships. Victorian Cliff Sharkey, and Canberran Mick Turner were amongst the male competitors, shooting with long or bare bows. Other male competitors included Bruce Lang, Joe Vardon and Rodney Cosolloe.\nMickey Fisher was a Canberra archer who smashed a national record on the first day of the competition.\nKirsten Filmer and her husband were one of several pairs of husband and wife competitors hoping to jointly gain selection to the World Championships. Archery Australia board members were also amongst the competitors today, including Jim Larven, the CEO of Archery Australia. While not eligible for the World Championships, he competed because he loves participating in the sport.\nStrahan is a Victorian competitor on the state team. Unlike the potential female Olympic competitors in the target event, she works full time and can drive. She does not have a rigorous training regime, believing the route to success in archery is to shoot as often as you possibly can.\nField archery is not an Olympic archery event; only target recurve is. Recurve bows are used in field archery competitions, alongside long bows and compound bows, and bows with sites and bows without sights. In field archery, the bow type is important beyond just competition class; it also dictates the distance the shooter stands from the target. The archers with recurve and compound bows who were shooting with long bow shooters would shoot first as they had a greater distance to the target because their bows had greater accuracy from distance.\nArchery fights to stay on the Olympic programme because of low spectator numbers and one of the smaller participation bases. After almost every Games, there are discussions about dropping the sport. As a result, there have been a number of changes designed to make the sport more spectator and camera friendly. Archery organisrs have narrowed the field to have only two lanes to allow spectators to be as close to the action as possible. They have also adjusted the distances for shooting. Archery improved their announcing at the Games to make the sport more accessible to a broader audience. They also reduced the number of eligible teams from sixteen to twelve in order to speed up the play.\nIn conversations with Stuart Atkins, the event's field manager, Wikinews learned there are few Paralympic archers in Australia, with none competing at the National Championships. Australian disability archers tend to do well in national competitions against able bodied competitors. Australia also has a few blind archers, who shoot with the assistance of a target that makes a sound to allow for targeting, and a sighted guide to retrieve arrows and score them.\nSeveral archers were asked why they were involved with archery instead of shooting. Most said they preferred the physical nature of archery. They also said some archers did both sports, with a preference towards pistol shooting in shooting events. Legal issues with guns in Australia have pushed some sport shooters out of the sport and into archery. Archery has another advantage over shooting sport in Australia in that archery clubs can be located in a city center, while shooting ranges need to be outside city limits. Archers are hesitant to discuss this issue too much though, as they fear the government who have tried before will try to license bow owning.\nThe funding to host the National Archery Championships is largely shared by the club hosting the competition, as is the case with Canberra who received no funding from the local government for the event. In the case of the Australian Capital Territory though, the territory government has supported the building of archery related facilities including their current stadium purpose built as a 2000 Summer Games training facility. The government is also paying the majority of the 2 million for a multisport facility in Tuggeranong.\nThe National Archery Championships will continue until Friday evening at the Tuggeranong Archery Club."}

From here, the three Australian women chosen to represent Australia will compete at the archery team event qualifier in the United States six weeks before the 2012 London Games. The possibility of individual qualification at the Games is another important part of the event, as Australia has only secured one spot for a female archer.\nThe only Olympic archery event is the target recurve competition, and it is the only event Ingley will be participating in at Nationals. She has competed in field recurve but is not competing to maximize her training for Olympic inclusion. She is hyper focused on the sport at the moment, with archery being her life.\nIngley, who might be related to the historical Robin Hood, is not a stranger to high level international competition, having competed at the 2010 Youth Olympics. This event was the only time she enjoyed substantial media interest, as otherwise archery is largely ignored by the Australian press. She has also competed at the first Youth Olympics, the Junior World Cup and two senior World Cups. She has also participated at the 2011 University Games in China and the 2011 Olympic Test Event in London.\nShe has an American doppelganger, Miranda Leek, and the two are sometimes mistaken for each other at international competitions.\nShe is a member of the Yokine Archery Club in Western Australia. Previously, for two and a half years, she had been affiliated with the archery program at the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS), but poor performances by the national team and other considerations led to the AIS dropping their high performance archery sport.\nIngley cannot drive, as she has not had the time to learn because of her archery focus. When not competing in archery, she works for Western Australian Newspapers. She deferred university for a year to try to realize her Olympic dream, taking time off from where she was working on a Bachelors of Arts in History. "}

Snazelle would not guarantee victory.\nEarlier this year, Snazelle shot a national record for 70/720 with a score of 652.\nParticipation in the Nationals is basically a compulsory event for Shadow Olympic Team members, as they have possible Olympic qualification implications for Snazelle as there are more girls on the shadow squad than eligible to compete on the full team at the Olympics, so cuts will be made based on performance at the event. On top of that, selection for the World Cup will be made based on the results of this event.\nThe seventeen year old from Sydney, who will celebrate her eighteenth in April, was asked about the lack of media coverage for the sport and said it related to the relative lack of popularity of archery in Australia. Movies like raise the visibility of the sport and temporarily bring in more participants. \nShe got into sport threes years ago, after watching her former Australian national championship father participate at a local club. Just sitting there and watching got boring so starting to play while at the club was a good way to pass time.\nSnazelle finished her HSCs last year and deferred admissions to the University of Sydney where she will major in engineering and medicine with the goal of becoming a for a year in order to further her Olympic dreams. She had originally planned to apply to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and had looked at continuing competing while in the United States but did not want to lose opportunities for national representation by being available for national competitions.\nShe is learning to drive but because of her busy archery schedule and because, according to Snazelle, Sydney drivers are crazy, she has yet to get her license.

Until Paul lifts his block, the Senate will not be able to act on legislation that has already passed the US House of Representatives last December. \"Wikinews\" has investigated the block on the legislation.\nSynthetic marijuana can be sold over the counter in some places and it is commonly known by brand names, such as \"K2\" or \"Spice\". Other types of synthetic \"designer\" drugs, like \"\", belong to a class of substances that are in some cases legal, though they create a health hazard, because they are declared not meant for human consumption.\nAt issue in the legislation is the amount of chemical substances banned, the criminalization of substances, the authority of the federal versus the state government to makes those decisions, the extent to which the product is a threat or hazard to public health and safety, and the effect such a law would have on the research of these substances. All of these issues were debated in the House. Paul has made an issue of the long prison sentences for marijuana. His critics claim he is going too far by blocking legislation. Paul, a who has libertarian leanings, has argued that the states should have the authority to ban drugs.\nAccording to the , 31 states have a ban on both synthetic and while 39 states have a ban on synthetic cannabinoids. Rand's home state of Kentucky bans both. But legislation is not a perfect solution; in Cass County, Michigan, four teenagers between the ages of 13 and 14 had an emergency after using synthetic marijuana, but even though Michigan bans both, police are not sure that the substances are illegal. Chemists have to conduct tests on the products.\nAlthough Paul is framing the issue as a legal one, the medical community has turned its attention to this new phenomenon's impact on public health and safety. In an article that appeared in the March 2012 issue of Pediatriacs, medical researchers led by Dr. Joanna Cohen analyzed the cases of three teens who were hospitalized and treated as emergencies after an incident of synthetic marijuana use. One 16-year-old girl lost her motor skills and was unresponsive yet she had an exceptionally high heart rate and abnormal blood pressure. An 18-year-old boy was extremely sweaty, had a high heart rate and was agitated. And a 16-year-old boy had a speech dysfunction, as well as symptoms of agitation and confusion. The doctors who wrote the study say people are using this product because they believe it can give them a high similar to marijuana, however, the new drug can bring on both psychological symptoms, like psychosis and paranoia, and physical ones, such as convulsions.\nOne out of every nine high school students has reported use of synthetic marijuana, according to released in December 2011. The annual survey can be used to spot new trends in substance use among youth and the report included synthetic marijuana for the first time in 2011.\nPoison centers noticed a sharp increase in calls reporting incidents due to synthetic marijuana. According to the , in 2010 centers nationwide took 2,906 calls for synthetic marijuana cases, but by 2011, they took 6,959 calls. The problem is noticeable to local health officials, like in , New York, which is Senator Chuck Schumer's state, where 120 cases were reported and one health professional called it \"a significant public health concern.\" New York has a ban on substituted cathinones but not synthetic canabanoids, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nAlthough the US placed five substances that fall under synthetic marijuana into on March 1, 2011, its emergency powers only last one and a half years and its ban has not stopped other substances from being used instead. Schedule I is a running list of banned chemicals.\nThree of Paul\u2019s Senate senior colleagues say Paul should drop his block. Senators , Chuck Schumer, and Amy Klobuchar are sponsoring bipartisan legislation that aims to ban synthetic marijuana as a serious health threat. The legislation is bipartisan as Grassley is a Republican , while both Schumer and Klobuchar are Democrats. Senator Schumer, in an editorial for the , advocated tackling synthetic marijuana at the national level rather than at the state. Schumer\u2019s argument is that states have tried to ban the ingredients commonly found these products but the manufacturers have the flexibility to alter the ingredients to bypass the law. Schumer said the federal government needs a proactive rather than a reactive stance against drugs. \"All we need is one senator, Rand Paul of Kentucky, to release his block on this legislation,\" wrote Schumer. \"We\u2019re urging him to do the right thing, and let us move forward with a vote.\"\nBefore the Senate took up the issue, similar legislation had already passed in the House. The House voted 317\u201398 in favor of the Synthetic Drug Control Act of 2011 on December 8, 2011. Pennsylvania Congressperson sponsored the legislation that would add ingredients found in synthetic marijuana to Schedule I. Dent\u2019s legislation included chemicals that are not even found in the United States at this time, but he argues that synthetic marijuana is too great of a public health threat to dismiss.\nStanding in opposition to the legislation, Virginia Congressperson and several fellow Democrats argued Dent's legislation was bypassing a process for the banning of drugs that was already in place and established. Scott also argued some of the substances banned by the legislation were not even present in the United States but so far only in Europe. His colleagues argued researchers would lose the ability to conduct research freely on these substances and, as Scott noted, the legislation was seeking to ban substances but without any research to back it up.\nGrassley's legislation is named for David Rozga, an Iowan who committed suicide after using synthetic marijuana. In his speech, before the Senate, Grassley said Rozga's situation inspired him to put forward the legislation.\nFor some families, the issue has also become an emotional one, as they have lost a loved one. Karen Dobner, a mother from , Illinois, is blaming Senator Paul for any deaths that may still occur because he is holding up a legislative solution to a problem that she says killed her own son. When her son Max was in college, he tried a synthetic marijuana product and had a panic attack. Dobner believes the car crash that killed her son would not have happened had he not been experiencing the symptoms of the designer drug. Now Dobner keeps calling Paul's office begging him to stop his hold.\nSenator Paul's office was contacted by both phone and email about this report but it did not respond."}

The late pope addressed the nation in 1998 and said that Cuba should \"open itself up to the world, and may the world open itself up to Cuba.\" Benedict's speech in Havana focused on the rise of religious freedom in Cuba since the 1990s \u2013 when the country dropped official atheism \u2013 as well as the need for more religious freedom in the country.\n\"It is with joy that in Cuba there have been steps so that the church can carry out its mission. ... The right to freedom of religion, as an individual and a community, manifests the unity of a human being, citizen and believer at the same time,\" he said.\nWhile Benedict kept the speech mostly apolitical, during the trip he made comments that could be interpreted as criticism of the communist country.\n\"There are those who wrongly interpret this search for the truth, leading them to irrationality and fanaticism; they close themselves up in 'their truth' and try to impose it on others,\" Benedict said.\nAlso during the trip, the pope prayed for greater freedom for Cubans at the statue of the in .

According to a Vatican spokesman, Castro asked for a \"modest and simple\" meeting with the pontiff. The two spoke for 30 minutes in which the former president \u2013 who stepped down in 2006 due to illness \u2013 asked the pope about the evolution of the Catholic church over the years and what life is like as a pope.\nCastro spoke of the pope in a positive light: \"...a man whose contact with children and humble members of society has, invariably, raised feelings of affection.\"\nPope Benedict left Cuba Wednesday evening."}

The white men also face five malicious harassment charges alleging the victims were targeted based on their race.\nPolice say Jake England, 19, and Alvin Watts, 33, confessed to the attacks. An affidavit says England shot three of the victims and Watts pulled the trigger on the other two. The apparently random attacks killed Dannaer Fields, 49, Bobby Clark, 54, and William Allen, 31. David Hall, 46, and Deon Tucker, 44, were hospitalised but survived and were discharged. \nAll were shot within three miles of each other on April 6 in a predominantly black area of the city; all but one were shot within a single mile of each other. The deceased were all hit in the chest. Hall was hit in the stomach and Tucker in the shoulder. Bond for each suspect has already been set at over 9 million, and no pleas have been entered. A witness to one shooting described a pickup pulling over so occupants could seek directions before someone inside fired a gun.\nA two-day manhunt concluded with the arrests last Sunday and police say the killing of England's father Carl by black man Pernell Demond Jefferson gave the younger suspect a possible \"axe to grind\". Jefferson was threatened by the elder England following an earlier incident and no charges were filed on the basis Jefferson acted in self defense.\nJake England recently wrote in Facebook \"it's hard not to go off,\" which was in reference to the second year since his father's death.

Friends and relatives say his father's death and girlfriend's suicide earlier this year have affected his mindset.\nTulsa County First Assistant District Attorney Doug Drummond called the events \"a tragic and senseless crime.\" Oklahoma law allows for life or death sentences for murder. The malicious harassment charges, which apply to some forms of discrimination, can fetch a year in prison each.

The United States halted its food aid, which had been part of the agreements, after Friday's failed launch.\nAlso on Tuesday, China delivered another stern warning to the nation through its party newspaper Global Times. In the statement, China expressed impatience with its neighbor and said China's foreign policy toward North Korea would not be hijacked by North Korea's leaders.

US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said China stood with other member nations of the Security Council in penalizing North Korea for future actions.\nIn a nation where speeches by leaders are rare, the young North Korean leader on Sunday said, \"Superiority in military technology is no longer monopolized by imperialists.\" The public event finished with the display of a new rocket and it further punctuated Kim Jong-un's call for making the military the nation's number one priority.\nSources.\n "}

[The issue] is a water quality issue in terms of the ground water resources that we use.\" \n, or fracking, is a technique used by the oil and gas industries which inject highly pressurized water down into the to break rock and extract natural gas. Most of the fluids used for fracking are proprietary, so information about what chemicals are used in the various fluids are unknown to the public and to create a competitive edge. \nLast Monday four researchers from the released an editorial that sheds light on the potential risks that the current wastewater disposal system could have on the province's water resources. The researchers share the concern that Dr. Doss has and have come out to say that they believe fracking should be stopped in the province until there is an environ\u00admentally safe way to dispose the waste wastewater.\n\"If groundwater becomes contamin\u00adated, it takes years to decades to try to clean up an aquifer system,\" University of New Brunswick professor Tom Al said.\nWhile the USGS group which conducted the study says it is unclear how the earthquake rates may be related to oil and gas production, they've made the correlation between the disposal of wastewater used in fracking and the recent upsurge in earthquakes. Because of the recent information surfacing that shows this connection between the disposal process and earthquakes, individual states in the are now passing laws regarding disposal wells. \n\"The problem is that we have never, as a human society, engineered a hole to go four miles down in the Earth\u2019s crust that we have complete confidence that it won\u2019t leak,\" Doss said. \"A perfect case-in-point is the oil spill in 2010, that oil was being drilled at 18,000 feet but leaked at the surface. And that\u2019s the concern because there\u2019s no assurance that some of these unknown chemical cocktails won\u2019t escape before it gets down to where they are trying to get rid of them.\"\nIt was said in the study released by the New Brunswick University professors that if fracking wastewater would contaminate groundwater, that current conventional water treatment would not be sufficient enough to remove the high concentration of chemicals used in fracking. The researchers did find that the wastewater could be recycled, can also be disposed of at proper sites or even pumped further underground into saline aquifers. \nThe New Brunswick professors have come to the conclusion that current fracking methods used by companies, which use the water, should be replaced with carbon diox\u00adide or liquefied propane gas.\n\"You eliminate all the water-related issues that we\u2019re raising, and that peo\u00adple have raised in general across North America,\" Al said.\nIn liquefied propane gas has been used successfully in fracking some wells, but according to water specialist with the province\u2019s Natural Resources De\u00adpartment Annie Daigle, it may not be the go-to solution for New Brunswick due its geological makeup. \n\"It has been used successfully by Corridor Resources here in New Bruns\u00adwick for lower volume hydraulic frac\u00adturing operations, but it is still a fairly new technology,\" Daigle said.\nThe (EPA) is working with U.S. states to come up with guidelines to manage seismic risks due to wastewater. Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the EPA is the organization that also deals with the policies for wells. \nOil wells, which are under regulation, pump out salt water known as , and after brine is pumped out of the ground it\u2019s disposed of by being pumped back into the ground. The difference between pumping brine and the high pressurized fracking fluid back in the ground is the volume that it is disposed of.\n\"Brine has never caused this kind of earthquake activity,\" Doss said. \"[The whole oil and gas industry] has developed around the removal of natural gas by fracking techniques and has outpaced regulatory development. The regulation is tied to the \u2018the run-of-the-mill\u2019 disposal of waste, in other words the rush to produce this gas has occurred before regulatory agencies have had the opportunity to respond.\" \nAccording to the USGS study, the increase in injecting wastewater into the ground may explain the sixfold increase of earthquakes in the central part of the United States from 2000 - 2011. USGS researchers also found that in decades prior to 2000 seismic events that happened in the midsection of the U.S. averaged 21 annually, in 2009 it spiked to 50 and in 2011 seismic events hit 134.\n\"The incredible volumes and intense disposal of fracking fluids in concentrated areas is what\u2019s new,\" Doss said. \"There is not a body of regulation in place to manage the how these fluids are disposed of.\"\nThe study by the USGS was presented at the annual meeting of the Seismological Society of America on April 18, 2012."}

One of his early campaign goals was to participate in a , but was never invited due to polling thresholds. However, Karger argued that he did meet the requirement for an August debate, but was still excluded after the organizers deemed polls he cited as inadequate. \nSo far, Karger has appeared on four Republican primary ballots including Puerto Rico, where he was able to top Congressman Ron Paul, who, at the time was one of the four major candidates in the race. Karger will next appear on the ballots in California on June 5, and in Utah on June 26. \nKarger brands himself as \"a different kind of Republican\" that wants to open the party to outsiders.

Some of your followers on Facebook wrote comments that this went too far. What is your response to them?\n2012 presidential campaign.\nLet's talk about the campaign. I've seen from your photos that while campaigning, you've encountered such candidates as and . Do they recognize you and/or acknowledge the historical significance of your campaign?\nYou previously said that one of your goals in your campaign was to participate in a GOP presidential debate, now that no more debates have been scheduled, what are you hoping to achieve by continuing your campaign?\nAs you've said, it seems very likely that Mitt Romney will win the Republican nomination. Might you support him in the general election?\nYour best showing in the Republican primaries so far came in Puerto Rico last month. In terms of campaigning, what did you learn from that experience?\nPuerto Rico is way behind the states in its support for gay civil rights. There's a gay and lesbian center that's only been open for one year, as opposed to the states where gay centers have been open for 25 or 30 years or more. So they are very much behind the times. But they are coming around. They are very grateful for my presence there. I got a lot of speaking engagements. The media was very interested. I was endorsed by the number one radio talk show host in , , who had interviewed me on her show. And she's a very prominent media personality. And when there was a hurricane there, they got her to chair the foundation. We just spoke, having fun with it. I didn't know that after that she would endorse me and that had a lot to do with it. \nPolitical views.\nLet's get into policy. You proposed that the voting age be reduced. How might you convince Republicans to support this when polls suggest that the youth generally support Democrats?\nConsidering the , should same sex marriage be a state issue?\nHow can high energy costs be reduced?\nThis is my last question. On your website you say that \"Israel must be defended at all costs.\" Does this apply to other nations as well, and if not, why should one nation be given preferential treatment over others?"}

The campaign was meant to raise awareness about the and its leader . Both support and condemnation followed the release of the video. \nThe video attracted over 100 million views and lead to significant discussion via an array of social networking sites. The campaign assertively called for people to \"pledge\" to stand up and take action against Joseph Kony and the Lord's Resistance Army. However, of the 104 million views of the film, only 3.4 percent of those people pledged to do something about the issue. \n\"I know that there is some criticism, in particular about the campaign and Invisible Children as an organization,\" said Josh Schuler, the director of programming at in Evansville, Indiana. \"I really think that some of that stuff is unfounded and people don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like for the Ugandans.\"\nSchuler is an advocate for Invisible Children's push to capture Joseph Kony. He has visited Uganda twice, once in 1997 and again in 2010. There, Schuler and a missions team from the church, spent the majority of their time speaking to school children in orphanages, and similar institutions and also addressed groups in various men's and women's prisons, in and around , Uganda. \nSome of the criticism of Invisible Children comes from people questioning what they do with their donations. Invisible Children\u2019s website provides financial statements from 2006 to 2011. Statements reveal that, in 2011 the organization's net income was US$4,870,547. However, the report does not state how the organization spends those monies. Invisible Children did not provide a statement to \"Wikinews\" about the net income. \n\u201cIf you look at Invisible Children\u2019s budget, a lot of it is awareness; raising money so they can build awareness, not necessarily so they can execute justice, because they are not a justice organization,\" Schuler said.\nInvisible Children's 2011 annual report compares their Central Africa Programs from 2011 with years 2010 and 2009. It shows that Invisible Children spent only 37 percent on these programs in 2011, compared with 46.5 percent in 2010, when Invisible Children made a revenue of 67 percent more in 2011 than in 2010. \n\u201cHonestly, even if Invisible Children was completely illegitimate, Kony is still a madman and he still needs to be brought to justice,\" Schuler said. Schuler emphasized that the value of awareness is huge, however he believes the next step to take is \"calling congressmen, senators and lobbying for them to take action.\" \n\"There are bills out there trying to allocate dollars that are already in the U.S. budget to continue to fund the work of these groups in countries to bring people to justice,\" Schuler said. \nThe United States is taking few steps to apprehend Kony. \u201cIf Uganda was resource rich to the degree that was, in the United States we would be talking about Joseph Kony to the same degree that we talk about Saddam Hussein, it\u2019s just that Uganda is not full of oil,\" Schuler said. \"There is no economic benefit for the U.S. to go prosecute [Kony], it\u2019s purely justice.\"\nUnited States President Barack Obama first assigned 100 troops in October 2011 in Uganda to search for Kony. On April 25, 2012 Obama announced that he had extended their time in Africa, aiming for Kony's capture. \"There is legislation out there; an organization, , which is a prosecuting organization working around the world for issues with , prosecuting cases with sex slavery and around the world,\" Schuler said. \nThere have also been questions raised asking whether Kony is even still alive and doubts about his current location. \"Kony and the LRA have been pushed out of Uganda, but they still do raids into northern Uganda,\" Schuler said. \"Taking Kony out, doesn\u2019t fix all of the problems. It would definitely start to help with some of it. And I think the corruption stuff could actually be solved democratically.\"\nThe film, released on March 5 shows clips of two different trips that co-founder and director of Invisible Children, , took to Uganda. They want to the campaign to raise awareness in hope that if enough people call for Kony's capture, US leaders would have to respond. Using this strategy, Invisible Children's goal is to detain Kony by December 2012. \nInvisible Children was started in 2004 after Jason Russell, Bobby Bailey and Laren Poole traveled to Uganda to film a documentary, \"Invisible Children: The Rough Cut\", about the ongoing civil war in Uganda. Since its establishment, Invisible Children has started multiple campaigns to raise awareness. \nAfter the initial release of the first Kony 2012 video, both support and condemnation followed. The negative reviews from the public lead Invisible Children to release a second video titled - \"Beyond Famous\", on April 2, 2012. The video was published to address the criticism and issues of the first video and shed light on what the organization has accomplished in Uganda."}

A run-off election is scheduled for May 6.\nHad the deal gone ahead it would have breached French law, which bans political donations of such magnitude. Although the document, apparently signed by Libya's then-foreign intelligence head , dates to 2006 and does not indicate any cash was actually handed over, some reports claim money was via Panama and Switzerland.\nSarkozy spokeswoman said the claims were \"ridiculous\" and invented by Hollande supporters. She said Sarkozy's election finances were vetted at the time. Hollande spokesman Bernard Cazeneuve said Sarkozy must now \"explain himself to the French in the face of such serious elements backed up by new documents emanating from the entourage of the Libyan dictator himself.\"\nIt is not the first time such allegations have been made. As France backed an uprising which ultimately toppled Gaddafi, the Libyan ruler's son last year made the same claim. \"Mediapart\" in March published allegations from a doctor who used to treat a local arms dealer, who said his patient had organised such a donation. Sarkozy himself said the suggestion was \"grotesque\".\nThe newly-released document states as present Libya's head of African investment, ; Sarkozy ally ; Libyan intelligence chief ; and arms dealer . It is dated October 6, 2006 and discusses an \"agreement in principle to support the campaign for the candidate for the presidential elections, Nicolas Sarkozy, for a sum equivalent to \u20ac50 million.\"\nHortefeux has denied ever meeting Kussa or Saleh. \n\"Mediapart\" is a respected left-wing investigative website. It is generally viewed as opposing Sarkozy's right-wing regime. It claims money was laundered via accounts including one in the name of Sarkozy's political party's head's sister, and says governmental briefing notes indicate regular funding trips to and from Libya. \"Mediapart\" says its sources are \"former senior officials now in hiding.\"\nWhen al-Islam first made his claims, he said \"Sarkozy must first give back the money he took from Libya to finance his electoral campaign. We funded it and we have all the details and are ready to reveal everything.\" Sarkozy was dismissive when interviewed this year on , saying \"I am sorry to see you in the role of a spokeswoman for Gaddafi\u2019s son, frankly I've known you in better roles... I am sorry that I am being interrogated about declarations of Gaddafi or his son on an important channel like TF1. When one quotes Mr Gaddafi, who is dead, his son, who has blood on his hands, that is a regime of dictators, assassins, whose credibility is zero... frankly, I think we have sunk low enough in the political debate.\"\nAn investigation is already ongoing into Takieddine. Takieddine is accused of illegally financing in an unsuccessful presidential bid in 1995. Sarkozy, who was spokesman for that campaign, denies wrongdoing in relation to it. It is suspected Balladur received from Pakistan in a submarine sale. Investigators believe eleven French engineers were killed in a bomb attack orchestrated as Pakistani revenge revenge for bribe non-payment.\nKosciusko-Morizet suggests Hollande's supporters arranged the new claims to coincide with allegations made by former International Monetary Fund head Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Strauss-Kahn fell from favour after a well-publicised sexual encounter with a hotel maid in the US and last week claimed Sarkozy arranged for allegations to be made in order to prevent Strauss-Kahn running against him for president.\n\"If he had financed it, I wasn\u2019t very grateful,\" Sarkozy said previously about the allegations. France played an active role in Gaddafi's downfall last year, providing military support to a NATO mission against the Libyan ruler."}
