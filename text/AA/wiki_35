Today, the IOC is scheduled to visit the proposed venues for the Olympic village and stadium. The inspection is scheduled to last four days.\nWhile at Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, IOC members met the captain and were given Real Madrid jerseys with their names on them.\nAs Spain is currently undergoing severe economic problems at the moment, with 26% unemployment currently and public debt in 2012 at 84% of the country's , the 1.5bn (1.9bn, 1.3bn) costs of the Games have been a highly visible aspect of the city's bid process. Security costs are estimated to add another \u20ac149m (US$192m, \u00a3127m) to organizing costs. Proponents of the bid including Madrid's mayor believe the Games would provide an economic boost to the city and the country. IOC President is also on the record as stating that he does not believe Spanish economic problems will play a part in the IOC's decision-making process. Spanish newspaper \"\" quoted Rogge saying, \"The crisis does not affect it, because substantial facilities have in most cases already been built. No major investment is needed\".\nBotella outlined some of the costs, quoted by the Associated Press during the IOC visit saying, \"The budget that remains for the construction of infrastructure, some 1.5 billion [euros] divided between the three administrations responsible and over a period of seven years, is a perfectly affordable amount.\" \nLocal organizers have promised to follow the legacy of London, using historical landmarks and existing venues with 80% of proposed venues, 28 of 35, already in place, and providing a roadmap for future development of Olympic sites to avoid any \"white elephants\" that are unused after the Games, a situation that happened with a number of Athens Olympic venues. Madrid's bid Chief Executive Victor S\u00e1nchez, quoted by , explained they avoided \"[p]rojects that have no real use for citizens after the Games have finished. That is why we have given priority to existing infrastructures and then to other infrastructures that the city has a direct need for. Finally, where a future use cannot be guaranteed, we have opted for temporary solutions. Only three such temporary solutions will be used, while a mere four permanent facilities remain to be built. The result is lower costs, reduced environmental impact and less disruption to the everyday lives of the people of Madrid, all with government backing at central, regional and municipal level.\"\nLocal organizers are preparing to cope with protesters trying to draw attention to Spain's labor situation who planned to picket outside the Hotel Eurostars Madrid Tower where IOC members are staying. The planned protest is over cuts to the Municipal Government budget. Protesters did not picket yesterday, which was a holiday in Madrid. Bid organizers and the government feared potential strikes by people working for the public transport system. Botella explained to the media that protests and work stoppages should not be seen as evidence that Spaniards would not welcome the Games, but rather unhappiness with local economic issues, which Botella said the Games should help fix. Spain's current unemployment level is the highest of any European country and the worst the country has faced since the 1970s. Botella's view is supported by an IOC survey, which found 81% of Spaniards supported Madrid's bid for the Games.\nMadrid is one of three cities currently competing for the 2020 Games. The IOC visited Tokyo, Japan earlier this month and is scheduled to visit Istanbul, Turkey later this month. The host city is to be formally selected at a meeting of the IOC on September 7 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Shortly after that, Rogge is scheduled to step down from his position as IOC President."}

Eastman is quoted by \"U.S. News and World Report\" as saying of Kennedy, \"All eyes are on Justice Kennedy and he's obviously written the two major gay rights decisions in the past decade and a half and that means that people rightly think that he's kind of open to taking this step, but he has studiously avoided taking that step in prior cases.\" Other court watchers agree with this sentiment.\nIn the lead up to the hearings, a number of high profile politicians have expressed their support for same-sex marriage including Democratic Senator of Virginia, Democratic Senator of Missouri, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Republican Senator of Ohio. Earlier this month, 40 United States senators signed a legal brief arguing against the constitutionality of the federal Defense of Marriage Act that was submitted to the Supreme Court.\nHigh visibility companies have also indicated support for legalized same-sex marriage in the United States, including where CEO Howard Schultz gave company support at a share-holder meeting last week.

Last week, a poll published by /Ipso found 63% of Americans supported same-sex marriage or civil unions. Despite this, social conservatives argue that this support may be over-stated by as much as 7% when voters are asked to voice their opinion on the issue at the ballot box.

Social conservatives also argue that people lie to pollsters to avoid appearing intolerant. 2000 Republican presidential candidate said on \"\", \"I\u2019m not worried about [same-sex marriage], because the polls are skewed.

This created the potential to drive up standard operating costs. Mele has also noted these additional costs though are still lower than the cost of diesel power.\n\"\" Pacific Correspondent Barbara Dreaver noted, \"Governments will be able to put the money they (currently) spend on diesel into things like education and health.\""}

The Conservative Party's 2010 \"contract for equalities\" reads, \"We will also consider the case for changing the law to allow civil partnerships to be called and classified as marriage.\"\nIn an interview with \"\", former cabinet minister and Conservative peer expressed concern about the possibility that a law legalising gay marriage would cause confusion regarding royal succession: \"When we have a queen who is a lesbian and she marries another lady and then decides she would like to have a child and someone donates sperm and she gives birth to a child, is that child heir to the throne?\"\nTebbit also argued the new law \"would lift my worries about inheritance tax because maybe I'd be allowed to marry my son.

I believe that the pendulum is now swinging so far the other way and there are plenty in the aggressive homosexual community who see this as but a stepping stone to something even further\". Howarth's comments sparked a trending topic on the social networking site Twitter.\nDavid Cameron has been on the political defensive since rumours circulated that Conservative Party co-chairman Lord Feldman referred to Conservative activists as \"mad, swivel-eyed loons\". Conservative Grassroots chairman Miles Windsor remarked, \"This week has begun a civil war in conservatism, it may rumble on for years \u2014 but as things stand, is winning it at a stride.\"\n, the government minister responsible for equality, tweeted after the vote on the third reading: \"Just won Third Reading vote of Equal Marriage Bill - After all the hard work, its moment to be proud of. It's the Right Thing\". Labour MP said: \"I did not think I would live to see the day this reached third reading.\"\nOn , David Cameron welcomed the passage of the bill: \"I think we should think about it like this \u2014 that there will be young boys in schools today who are gay, who are worried about being bullied, who are worried about what society thinks of them, who can see that the highest Parliament in the land has said that their love is worth the same as anybody else\u2019s love and that we believe in equality. I think they will stand that bit taller today and I\u2019m proud of the fact that that has happened.\""}

As the jury gave its guilty verdict, a shout from Aitchison's family could be heard, calling the defendants a \"pair of monsters\".\nSpeaking outside the court, Norrie Aitchison said his son \"fought to defend himself but he didn't stand a chance against the violence he came against that night.\" After calling the experience of this murder case one which \"no family should have to endure\", Aitchison said of the convicted: \"The cowards who robbed our Liam of his life and his future should never be able to see the outside of a prison ever again.\"\nLiam \"had his whole life in front of him\", said Detective Inspector Andy Logan, who was the senior investigator of his murder. He said MacKinnon and Millar had \"completely betrayed this trust, and in a most brutal and callous way they killed him in a senseless and sustained attack with weapons.\" The Detective Inspector called the murder case \"a very rare occurrence in what is normally one of the safest places in Scotland\". The crime rate in the Outer Hebrides is amongst the lowest for any region in the United Kingdom; the last murder enquiry to take place on the islands was in 1968. \"It was therefore, very shocking to the close-knit community,\" Detective Inspector Logan said."}

They killed an innocent boy in cold blood but, by the time they leave jail, they will still be young enough to make plans for the rest of their lives.\" Claire and her husband Norrie had criticised the Scottish legal system after the guilty verdicts were given for the way it could allow murder suspects to be granted bail after MacKinnon and Millar were both granted bail in February 2012 and December 2011 respectively. \"We want to head up a campaign to keep anyone that is charged with murder on remand until proven innocent or guilty,\" Norrie Aitchison said.\nIn a statement, Detective Inspector Andy Logan, the senior investigator of Aitchison's murder, said the crime had \"caused considerable distress in such a small community.\" He also said \"Liam's family have also had to cope with the loss Liam in the most tragic of circumstances and hopefully [these] sentences will help to reassure the community and help the family in coming to terms with their terrible loss.\" North of Scotland Liam Murphy said Aitchison's murder \"caused shock and concern in this small community of Lewis and across Scotland\" but stressed there was a low murder rate in this region. \"I hope that these murder convictions reassure those communities that when we do have such crimes, justice will be done,\" he added."}

Conference Wednesday, and discussed the proposal. It stems from rural Colorado's perceived isolation from the rest of the state as a result of such policies as stricter gun control laws, agricultural regulation, and oil and gas regulation. According to the commissioners, the \"[s]traws that broke the camel's back\" in support of secession, included Colorado Statute S.B. 252, which Governor signed last week to increase renewable energy standards in rural Colorado. Local energy companies consider the statute too costly to their industry. In addition, Weld County commissioner Sean Conway, who proposed the idea, argues that though revenue from his county's agricultural and oil and gas sectors account for 70 percent of Colorado's state budget, state funds for the county's schools and road improvements remain low.\nThe counties could place the idea on the ballot as soon as the November 2013 elections. According to Tom Norton, Mayor of , the largest city in what would be North Colorado, many people in his city are upset over the state government. A poll on the city's \"The Tribune\" newspaper website shows 49.66 percent support the idea of seceding from Colorado, while 44.15 percent oppose it, and 6.19 percent believe the counties should instead secede from the U.S. \nNevertheless, seceding from a U.S. state requires permission from both the U.S. Congress and the original state legislature. Steve Mazurana, a former professor of Political Science at the , sees this as the death of idea: \"All the rest of the states are not going to want to share their federal aid with this new state...And the state is not going to give up oil and gas money on a whim.\"\nSince the 1863 secession of West Virginia from Virginia, no state has successfully seceded. The three most recent efforts all failed in 2011. Chicago was unable to secede from Illinois, Florida could not be split in half, and the southern part of Arizona could not break away to create Baja Arizona."}

It must also provide to its competitors \"reasonable access\" to advertising opportunities on its radio stations.\nWhen the deal is completed, BCE's share of the English-language and French-language market will grow to 35.8% and 22.6%, respectively. BCE will be required to keep running all of its local TV stations while maintaining their current levels of local programming."}

Countries with less acceptance than Russia included in the survey include Lebanon, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Tunisia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Pakistan, Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, Senegal and Nigeria. Negative Russian attitudes towards homosexuality are also supported by research conducted by Russian .\nThe homosexuality issue as it pertains to Russian law comes against the backdrop of the 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics scheduled to be hosted in the Russian city of Sochi early next year. Last week, Russian Minister of Sport reaffirmed the country will enforce these laws during the Games and foreign athletes, journalists and spectators will be subject to them."}

Part of the \"Dispatches\" series, the show reported on an incident in Spain last year where three Ryanair jets declared fuel emergencies after being diverted to . Fuel policy was a strong focus for the documentary.\nPilots interviewed for the programme said they felt pressured to save fuel, the cost of which has hit Ryanair's profits. The described Ryanair flights usually landing with a bare minimum of fuel, in a report the airline dismissed as \"manifestly inaccurate and factually untrue\".\nRyanair have also sacked veteran pilot John Goss for appearing on the show, the only pilot interviewed who did not seek anonymity. Ryanair have stated intent to sue Goss and claim he confirmed in the weeks before the show that he had no issues with his employer's safety. Goss is a member of Ryanair Pilots Group (RPG), which the airline call a union front.\nChannel 4 previously promised when threatened with legal action to see Ryanair in court. \"We stand by our journalism, and will robustly defend proceedings if they are initiated,\" a spokesperson said. \"\" was also sued but the action has been dropped after the Northern Irish publication issued an apology. The paper had published a story titled \"Are budget airlines like Ryanair putting passengers at risk?\".\nAssociated Newspapers are behind ' and its online and Sunday variants. Mirror Group publish ', its Sunday sister, and \"\".\n\"Secrets of the Cockpit\" also examined an RPG poll of 1,000 Ryanair flight crew, dismissed by the airline as part of unionisation efforts. According to the RPG survey almost 90% of respondents said the safety culture was nontransparent. Two-thirds said they felt uncomfortable raising safety issues, with a pilot interviewed by Channel 4 accusing Ryanair of \"threats and bullying\". Ryanair had told pilots anybody signing a \"so-called safety petition\" might be dismissed. \nOver 90% of those surveyed wanted a regulatory inquiry, with RPG saying the survey results were passed to the airline and the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA). The IAA has already called the programme a \"misguided attack\" on Ryanair, saying \"Ryanair Plc fully complies with all European and international regulations in all areas of its operations\".\nThe IAA itself was accused of failing to respond to concerns from Ryanair pilots and one interviewee said his \"personal belief is that the majority of Ryanair pilots do not have confidence in the safety agencies and that is a pretty critical issue\". The authority responded \"The IAA has responded to personal letters and reports from Ryanair pilots, this included several meetings and face-to-face interviews with pilots and their legal and professional representatives.\"\nRyanair makes heavy use of , which do not guarantee work and which the Irish Airline Pilots' Association describe as offering some of aviation's worst employment conditions. RPG chairman Evert van Zwol, also a recent Dutch Airline Pilots Association president, said zero-hour contracts tended to make pilots choose to fly when unwell and keep quiet if they had safety concerns. In 2005 a Polish Ryanair pilot became lost near Rome a few days after attending his son's funeral, while his Dutch co-pilot was seeing his first experience of navigating severe weather.\nIn the 2005 incident intervened to keep the flight safe from midair collisions. The Polish pilot told Italian investigators he feared losing his job if he took extra time off work. The investigation concluded in 2009 he had been unfit to fly. Ryanair denied he would have been fired for taking time off to recover.\n\"Secrets of the Cockpit\" also reported that in twelve separate serious incidents data from had been wiped before investigators could access it, which the carrier says is a common occcurrence in aviation and attributed to . \nIn Sweden a report into a Ryanair emergency landing concluded this week an airline employee wiped the cockpit voice recorder and to prevent the investigation accessing them. The aircraft had returned to an airport near Stockholm shortly after takeoff suffering electrical malfunctions. Ryanair reject the Swedish Accident Investigation Authority's take on the missing data, telling newspaper \"\" recordings were reset by a technician trying to repair the aircraft after consultation with Ryanair's technical department, who did not think the recordings needed saving.\nRyanair, which has never suffered a fatal accident, says the documentary is \"false and defamatory\", and the IAA says it is \"based upon false and misleading information\". \"We have been instructed to vigorously prosecute these libel proceedings,\" said a statement from Ryanair's lawyers, who promised \"other litigation is pending\"."}

Many of those killed appeared to be children.

Syrian officials say the alleged chemical attack was staged and carried out by rebel forces to \"draw attention to their cause\" ahead of the arrival of UN observers.\nDeputy Secretary-General of the UN, Jan Eliasson, called the alleged chemical attack 'shocking' and hopes the Syrian government will allow UN observers into the neighborhood as soon as possible. \n\"We see the need to investigate this as soon as possible; no matter what the conclusions, this represents a serious escalation with grave humanitarian and human consequences,\" said Eliasson who also added there is no confirmation that chemical weapons were used in Wednesday's bombing.\nA previous attempt by the UN to end the violence in Syria failed.

Pictures also show grenades, rockets and what appear to be several other unknown chemical agents. Government forces say the stockpile belonged to rebels and opposition forces.\nThe country's largest opposition group, The Syrian National Coalition (CNFROS), released a statement denying the use of chemical weapons in both today's and Wednesday's battles. They deny even possessing chemical weapons saying the \"information disclosed by the regime [is] false\" and the accusations attempt \"to disguise and conceal his [Assad's] repeated and systematic crimes against Syrian civilians.\" \nThe seizure comes just days after government forces were accused of carrying out a large-scale chemical attack in the region of Damascus on Wednesday. Reports say anywhere between 100 and 1,300 people were killed in the attack. Prior to today's incident and after Wednesday's alleged chemical attack, government forces heavily bombed the area. \nThe fighting comes as United Nations observers arrived to investigate claims of chemical weapons use elsewhere in the nation. According to one report, government forces have retaken control of Jobar."}

We need to look into this issue more.\" TEPCO initially said the leak was small when it was found in July and the watchdog gave it a level one \"anomaly\" rating at the time. Inspectors now say radiation below this tank stands at 100 per hour, and another at the facility has a level of 70 millisieverts per hour.\n\"One hundred millisieverts per hour is equivalent to the limit for accumulated exposure over five years for nuclear workers; so it can be said that we found a radiation level strong enough to give someone a five-year dose of radiation within one hour,\" said TEPCO boss Masayuki Ono last week.

The government motion was defeated by opposition from the Labour Party, as well as rebel MPs from both the Conservative and Liberal Democratic parties.\nDavid Cameron argued the recent events in Syria were a \"humanitarian catastrophe, and if there are no consequences for it, there is nothing to stop Assad and other dictators from using these weapons again and again\". The motion rejected by the Commons said the House \"agrees that a strong humanitarian response is required from the international community and that this may, if necessary, require military action\", and such action would be \"legal, proportionate and focused on saving lives by preventing and deterring further use of Syria's chemical weapons\".\nThirty Conservative MPs and nine Liberal Democrats voted against their party against military intervention. Ed Miliband, leader of the opposition Labour Party, said the proposal to go to war was an \"ill-thought through action\", it lacked international support, and Cameron had acted in a \"cavalier and reckless\" manner.\nDeputy Prime Minister and Liberal Democratic leader Nick Clegg said the sole intention of the government's motion was to \"relieve humanitarian suffering by deterring and disrupting the further use of chemical weapons. Nothing more, nothing less. Not invasion. Not regime change... President Obama's intentions are highly limited and so are ours.\"\nThe former foreign secretary and Conservative MP Sir Malcolm Rifkind said during the debate: \"The Assad regime in Damascus are watching very carefully as to whether they will get away with what they have done.\"\nOpposition came also from Britain's smaller parties: Caroline Lucas from the Green Party said the actions \"cannot be justified\", and expressed concern that the United Kingdom would be \"flouting international law\" by going into Syria. Respect MP George Galloway argued there was \"no compelling evidence\" of Syrian government involvement in the chemical weapons attack.\nLabour proposed an opposing motion that called for the government to present \"compelling\" evidence before action, which was rejected as well as the government's motion. The defeat of the government motion for military intervention has surprised some. Shadow Defence Secretary said \"Parliament is entirely unpredictable sometimes and I don't think many people saw this coming.\"\nPhilip Hammond, the Defence Secretary, confirmed that following the vote, the country would not participate in any action in Syria, but he noted he expected the United States to carry on without the UK, anticipating \"the US and other countries will continue to look at responses to the chemical attack. They will be disappointed that Britain will not be involved. I don't expect that the lack of British participation will stop any action.\"\nHammond noted the rejection of military intervention would strain the \"special relationship\" between Britain and the United States.\nThe former leader of the British Army, General Lord Dannatt, said the vote in the Commons was a \"victory for common sense\".\nThe United States has said they will still seek military action against the Syrian regime. US defense secretary Chuck Hagel said the US would seek to build an \"international coalition\". Caitlin Hayden, spokeswoman for the White House, reacted to the British vote by saying: \"The US will continue to consult with the UK Government \u2014 one of our closest allies and friends.\"\nHayden said that President Obama \"will be guided by what is in the best interests of the United States\", and that Obama \"believes that there are core interests at stake for the United States... countries who violate international norms regarding chemical weapons need to be held accountable\".\nRepresentative , a Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the White House had told them \"beyond a doubt [...] chemical weapons were used, and used intentionally by the Assad regime\", and that there is evidence from intercepted communications of involvement by \"high-level Syrian officials\".\nThe Parliamentary vote on intervention in Syria is on the front pages of many of the national newspapers in Britain, with \"The Times\" claiming Cameron was \"humiliated\" by the vote."}

This family-friendly nature ramble meandered along the mountain's ridge, with locals enjoying the forest, sharing a cup of and knowledge about the local forest's ecology and history. The physical presence of the locals in the forest demonstrated their continued use of this area and the importance of national parks for the community. \nSince early 2012, the possibility of logging for commercial timber in NSW national parks had been emerging. A state government inquiry on the management of public land in NSW received submissions and evidence from both the Australian and NSW Forest Products Associations (FPA). The FPA's recommendation to \"tenure swap\" between national parks and state forests in order to sustain the timber industry were included in the final governmental report.\nThe process began in April 2012 when the \u2014the upper house of the parliament of NSW\u2014 established an inquiry into the management of public land in New South Wales, conducted by the General Purpose Standing Committee No. 5. According to a media release from the Legislative Council at the time, the primary purpose of the inquiry was to \"scrutinise the management of the State's public land and review the process and impact of converting Crown Land, State Forests or agricultural land into National Park estate.\" \nBy August that year, the committee had received a recommendation from Mr. Grant Johnson of the Australian Forests Products Association for the \"re-introduction of harvesting activities in forest areas previously set aside for conservation.\" The following month, Mr. Johnson and Mr Russell Alan Ainley, Executive Director, NSW Forest Products Association, were invited before the committee. At this hearing, the chair, , member for the Shooters and Fishers Party, asked Mr. Ainley for \"a calculation of the area currently in [national parks] reserve that would need to be returned [to state forest] to be available for timber extraction\". In response, Mr. Ainley suggested \"a little more than one million hectares.\" \nOn May 15, the NSW Legislative Council published a Final Report on the management of public land in New South Wales. Among its key recommendations was that \"the NSW Government immediately identify appropriate reserved areas for release to meet the levels of wood supply needed to sustain the timber industry, and that the NSW Government take priority action to release these areas, if necessary by a 'tenure swap' between national park estate and State forests. In particular, urgent action is required for the timber industry in the Pilliga region.\" \nA \"tenure swap\" would reserve areas of NSW state forest where logging is now allowed, in exchange for opening areas of national parks for logging.\nEnvironment groups such as The Nature Conservation Council of NSW and announced that these government documents signaled an immediate threat of logging in national parks in NSW. This information raised concerns of other community and activist groups because logging is not conducted in national parks in Australia. According to the , a national park is an area designated to \"protect Australia's plants, animals, ecosystems, unique geology and Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal cultural connections to the land.\"\nThe was one of many parks listed by the environment group Save Your National Parks as potentially vulnerable for \"tenure swap\". This forest covers 1554 hectares and connects Dungog Shire to the World Heritage listed , part of a from the ocean to the mountains.\nResidents living near the forest were concerned by the proposal for logging in their area. A local information day held in June, at the Settlers Arms, Dungog, motivated local action. As a consequence of the event, over forty hand-written letters were posted to the Premier and local MPs. In a recent reply from the NSW government, the Minister for the Environment, Robyn Parker, stated: \"The Government does not support commercial logging in national parks and reserves, including Black Bulga State Conservation Area, and has no plans to allow it. The NSW Government recognises that our national parks and reserves are special and unique places that deserve enduring protection. The Government is committed to their important role in conserving native flora and fauna and cultural heritage, and to improving community well-being through increased opportunities for recreation and tourism\".\nAs reported in the Dungog Chronicle, Jo New of the Black Bulga Range Action Group was thrilled by the government's response to a community-driven campaign. \"It goes to show what a wonderful impact local people can have after they do something simple, like posting a letter\"."}

Today the national Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) said contaminated water may be pumped into the sea.\nTanks holding contaminated water at the site continue to leak; operator Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) says up to 300 may have leaked from one tank alone. Radiation at that tank soared to 1,800 per hour yesterday, a rate lethal to an exposed human in about four hours. Japanese law says nuclear workers cannot be exposed to more than 50 millisieverts in a year.\nTEPCO says other locations at the plant have readings of 70\u2013230 millisieverts per hour. Waste water totalling more than 300,000 tons has already been collected at the site; more is being stored at a rate of 400 tons per day. An unknown quantity of radioactive groundwater is flowing into the sea.\nNRA boss Shinichi Tanaka told a press conference today that stored water may be pumped into the after treatment to reduce contamination to within legal limits. \"I'm afraid that it is unavoidable to dump or release the water into the sea,\" he said, adding \"careless management\" was being applied to the water by TEPCO. \nTEPCO first noticed a leak at the now-deadly tank in July but said it was minor and the NRA gave it a level one \"anomaly\" rating on the . Last week that was raised to \"serious incident\", level three, after TEPCO said up to 300 tons of water had leaked. The exact amount is unknown as there is no gauge to measure levels inside the tank and TEPCO staff had said water levels in the tank had remained constant.\nLast week levels under the tank, where lost water is thought to have seeped into the ground, stood at 100 millisieverts per hour, and another at the facility had a level of 70 millisieverts per hour. TEPCO found another leak yesterday in a pipe between coolant tanks. Highly radioactive material was dripping out, but TEPCO says the leak is now fixed. Monitoring at the site has been increased since the original leak's discovery two weeks ago.\nAround 1,000 tanks are used to store water from the power plant's coolant system, which was contaminated when three reactors melted down after a tsunami in March 2011. Around 160,000 people were evacuated in the worst nuclear disaster since 1986. Tanaka said \"The situation at Fukushima is changing everyday... The accident has yet to be settled down.\"\nThe new radiation involves , TEPCO said, which can be stopped with a sheet of metal. Water treatment has extracted from the tanks but other radioactive elements remain. TEPCO's equipment to remove other contamination is out of action due to filter corrosion after a few months of operating, but the government has demanded it be returned to service this month.\nNone of the tanks have monitoring equipment and TEPCO's initial procedure involved two employees manually checking each tank over a two-hour period. Since the tank was found to be leaking the total monitoring staff has increased from ten to 60, and patrols are carried out four times a day instead of twice a day.\nProsecutors brought criminal charges against TEPCO and government officials including then-Prime Minister Naoto Kan for their handling of the crisis formed after the tsunami. Daily newspaper \"\" today claimed all charges, brought after local residents complained, were to be dropped. \"Sankei Shimbun\" suggests a formal announcement may come within days.\n today began shutting down one of only two reactors still generating power in Japan, reactor #3 at , for mandatory inspection. The other, Oi's reactor #4, is to be permanently switched off this month. When the accident began nuclear energy supplied a third of Japan's power requirements, but in the aftermath of Fukushima the nation has switched to fossil fuels."}

The ball was so small it could be ; light beams exert a force called .\nWith the ball held within a vacuum by a laser trap, the scientists were able to apply a twisting force through the light's (orientation) as it passed through the ball.

How did you end up with this unusual record \u2014 was it by accident?\n How was the sphere manufactured, and how long did it take? \n How long did the sphere take to reach 600 million revs per minute and break up?\n Could the high speeds attained be taken as evidence against quantum friction, as the sphere simply kept getting faster until it broke apart?\n The experiment failed to conclusively prove quantum friction, but did it provide any evidence to support the theory?\n How challenging is research of this sort? What kind of difficulties are encountered?\n Previous research on the boundary between conventional and quantum physics has used atoms and individual molecules. Why was a sphere in excess of a million atoms appropriate for this experiment? Would that not move further away, rather than closer to, the boundary between the two?\n How likely is this result to be an anomaly? Might a similar ball break up more quickly, or be unable to spin as fast?\n Where would you like to see the research go next? More spheres?\n If confirmed, what applications might quantum friction have?\n One follow-up question for publication: You said you found smaller spheres more difficult to levitate. Why is that?"}

Game Six followed immediately after at 19:30. This game, between Australia and United States attracted a sizable and animated crowd that filled the venue.

India was mentioned over 300 times in the report, many more times than more developed countries like Spain which was mentioned 48 times, New Zealand which was mentioned 15 times, and Canada which was mentioned 22 times.\nThe report mentions the importance of gender equality for national development as it ties into improve productivity, improved outcomes for the next generation, and more representative decision making. Across the board for India, improved gender equality on the local level led to improvements in sanitation, water supplies, irrigation, and schools. \nNationally, the report found that a woman's income correlated positively with the number of years her children spent in school. There is no gender gap in male/female attendance for the richest 20% of Indian families, but males outnumber females by a ratio of 5 to 1 for the poorest 20% of Indian families. Girls in the bottom 20% on average only finish Grade 1 while males finish Grade 6. By age 15, according to , Indian parents from Andhra Pradesh prioritize family outcomes for their male children over their female ones.\nIndian women earn 0.64 for every $1 earned by their male counterparts. They fare better proportionally than their female German counterparts who earn $0.62 and Georgia who earn $0.60. In the developing world, they lag behind Malawi where women earn $0.90 for every $1 earned by men, Egypt where women earn $0.82, and Benin and Mexico at $0.80. A fifth of married Indian women, including those with their own income, do not make decisions on household spending. The 18% average puts Indian female control of their earnings equal to their counterparts in Mozambique. India is between Nigeria at 14%, and Zambia and Rwanda at 20%.\nIndian women are having fewer children. The report found that while it took 100 years for the average woman in the United States to go from having six children to having three, it took India only 35 years. Women still have high maternal mortality rates, especially when compared to neighboring Sri Lanka. India's rate is six times as high. Very young females still die at very high rates in India, especially in , because of gender preferences for male children. While according to the report this trend is spreading nationally, the overall number of excess females deaths dropped by 8,000 from 265,000 in 1990 to 257,000 in 2008. In China, the total excess female deaths grew by 202,000. The report cites improved access to and similar technologies as a cause for the very high rates in both India and China because it allows parents to select the sex of their child. \nIn a national exception, the height of North Indian women increased more slowly and they had worse proportional to their male counterparts.\nEstimates by the World Bank report writers based on suggest 15% of Indian women think it is acceptable for a husband to beat his wife if she refuses to have sex with him, 20% if she burns food and 30% if she argues with him.\nEconomic well being plays a role in the number of children a woman has. The richest 20% of women average around 1.5 total children. The poorest 20% average about 4 children. India's poorest 20% is comparable to Colombia and the Dominican Republic. The number is much lower than many Afrian countries including Niger, Mali, Zambia, Malawi, Liberia, Nigeria, Tanzania and Kenya where the poorest 20% average over 7 children.\nThe Indian gains highlighted include several local ones. This includes using women's self-help groups focused on in farming in the state of Orissa. The Self Employed Women\u2019s Association has assisted women in Gujarat by providing childcare. Quotas for women elected in local governments led to changes in underlying beliefs about the effectiveness of women in government. The creation of an all-women's police force in Tamil Nadu led to increased reporting of crimes against women and general comfort in going to the police to report a problem.\nThe report offers several pieces of advice for Indian policy makers, including trying to change current role models to include more women who do not follow social norms. It advises laws be created and enforced to prevent sex selection of children. The report also encourages strengthening ownership and land rights, which should also address the agricultural productivity gender-gap."}

With few specific mentions of Australia, women in the country appear to be doing better than many other countries discussed. This includes areas like education, health, life expectancy, and willingness to work part time.\nIn 1979, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the (CEDAW). Early on, the report credits the , inspired by CEDAW, with dealing with inequality issues such as discrimination based on sex, marital status, and pregnancy or potential pregnancy.\nThe WDR 2012 team estimates based on found little change in attitudes for people who agree that university education is more important for boys than girls, with around 8% of Australians saying yes between 1994 and 1999, and 5% saying yes between 2005 and 2007. About 25% of Australians said men should have more rights to jobs than women between 1994 and 1999. This dropped to 15% between 2005 and 2007.\nThe report says married Australian women working part-time are amongst a few nationalities who prefer their current working hours, and would not desire to change to a full time position. The report contrasts this to Honduras where married women working part-time would like to move to full-time but are unable to do so because of the lack of available employment.\nThe report suggests economic well being is not a good predictor of Australian female fertility. The top 20% of female earners have an average of about 1.5 children compared to the bottom 20% who have an average of 2 children.\nWhile girls score slightly lower than boys on the mathematics test at around 510 to 520 on the mean score, girls outperformed boys in literacy approximately 530 to 500. The report attributes overall patterns of girls outperforming boys at literacy and boys outperforming girls at maths to gender expectations reinforced in textbooks. It sites current examples of this in Australia and Hong Kong. On the maths test, Australian girls slightly outperformed girls from Estonia, Belgium and Germany, while girls from New Zealand, Macau, the Netherlands, Canada, Japan, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Finland, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore outperformed their Australian counterparts. On the literacy test, Australian girls slightly outperformed their Norwegian and Polish counterparts. The only countries sampled outperforming Australian girls at literacy were Japan, New Zealand, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong, Finland and South Korea. \nFrom 1991 to 2009, the for Australian females in primary and secondary school declined by 1% and 2% respectively. For tertiary education, there was a 52% increase for females. The average life expectancy of Australian women went from 80 in 1990 to 84 in 2009. During the same period, male life expectancy grew from 74 years to 79 years. Australia's Parliament had 6% women in 1990 and grew to 25% women in 2010."}

Parents have a government mandated nine months leave, three for the mother, three for the father and three to to distribute between the two. Leave is paid at 80% of their wages. The report describes the changes in gender relations in Iceland as \"promising\" in terms of impact at work and at home.\nIceland's boys and girls scores for the mathematics test were nearly identical with boys just edging out girls with both scores around 510. Girls outperformed boys on the literacy test with a mean score of approximately 525 to 480. Iceland's girls mathematics performance was similar to that of girls from Estonia, Germany and Belgium. Their performance on literacy was similar to Sweden, Poland, Switzerland, Estonia and Belgium. \nMortality rates in Iceland for 1,000 people aged 15\u201360 sits at 56, significantly better than the United States at 107, China at 113, India at 213, Iraq at 285, Afghanistan at 479, Malawi at 481 and Zimbabwe at 772. One of the reasons the report cites for Iceland's relatively low mortality rate is it not located in a conflict country or in an HIV/AIDS affected country.\nIceland was one of 23 countries that currently have over 30% of its who are female. Other countries with over 30% representation include Rwanda, Argentina, Cuba, Finland, the Netherlands, and Sweden. In the mid-1990s, there were only 5 countries. The report cites the 1983 creation of the , an all women's political party, as bringing additional attention to women's issues and deliberately attempting to increase the representation of women in Icelandic politics.\nDespite some of the good news highlighted in the report about Icelandic women, there exists a systematic gender difference in earning potential. Icelandic women in both the private and public sector earn approximately 22% less than their male counterparts. Icelandic men have slightly more access to the Internet than Icelandic women by about 2%. Despite this slight disadvantage for Icelandic women, it is much better than some countries where the percentage differences are much greater.

For Jamaica the report highlights a number of negative gender issues for the nation's men.\nThe report claims that getting an education in Jamaica is viewed as primarily a female activity. This cultural attitude encourages males to leave school early. In 2008, girls outnumbered boys in secondary school by a ratio of 1.04:1. At the same time, boys were more likely to have to repeat a year of school. Only 16% of boys passed five or more exams compared to 30% of girls. Boys outperformed girls only in vocational subjects and physics. The report cites four key challenges in boys' development identified by a national programme. They are low self-esteem, limited future employment opportunities, lack of discipline, and masculine identities that eschew education. \nA program in Jamaica uses cash incentives to encourage at-risk boys to stay in school; other countries like Pakistan use cash incentives to encourage girls to stay in school. Jamaica's program has resulted an average increase in boys attending school by 0.5 days a month. At the same time, fathers are urged to become more involved with their childrens' schooling and changes are being made to the curriculum to make it \"more boy-friendly\".\nDefinitions of masculinity result in less employment opportunities and smaller earnings potential. The report claims Jamaican definitions of masculinity also encourage more risky behavior, and sexual behaviors valuing achievement and competence above intimacy. The report says these factors increase physical and sexual violence towards women.\nMale mortality is increasing in Jamaica. The report cites crime and violence as causes."}

The United States is referred to many times, often as a benchmark to foster understanding of recent gains for women in other parts of the globe. At the same time, United States women still lag behind US men in a number of areas.\nIn 2012, the authors note women in the United States still face challenges economically and socially. They are represented disproportionately in certain professions like teaching and nursing. They are paid less than their male counterparts. Jobs traditionally held by women also result in lower wages for men who hold these jobs. They are under-represented at the highest level of business, with only 28 of Fortune 1000 companies having a female chief executive officer. The bottom 20% of women economically have a slightly higher birth rate than their peers in the top 20%. \nImmigrants to the United States from Southeast Asia and India have higher than expected male to female birth ratios, which the report authors suggest is partially deliberate sex selection based on cultural attitudes from home countries. In 2009, over half a million US women were victims of intimate partner violence. The report suggests US men have greater pension assets than US women. When compared to elderly US men, elderly women in the United States are more likely to live alone than with a spouse. US women are disproportionately under-represented in local police forces, accounting for less than 20% of all police officers. Women in the United States also bear a higher percentage of housework duties than men at 61%. When US women take part time work while raising children, they find it difficult to use that work experience to gain future full time employment. US women are disincentivized from re-entering the workforce after giving birth because of the high cost of childcare.\nMany of the gains for United States women took place a while ago and took a long time to get. It took 40 years, 1870\u20131910, to see major improvements in the percentage of girls aged 6 to 12 attending school. In 1921, after women got the , the United States Congress passed the . This assisted in lowering infant mortality from 23% to 15%. \nThe report says in the United States resulted in jobs transferring from men to women, but the authors hedged and did not draw a conclusion about the economic impact of these legislative efforts other than to say the impact was not negative. \nMany of the legislative victories for United States women came early compared to developing countries. Property rights for women, while later than some of their European counterparts like Norway and the United Kingdom, started to come by 1848. That year, the was passed in New York. It was the first legislation of its kind in the country. Other states soon followed. Women got on a state-by-state level in the country until they got federal suffrage in 1920. barred discrimination against women and allowed married women to make loans without their husband's consent. In 1980, airlines were barred from discriminating against flight attendances for their marital status during the hiring and firing stage.\nThe number of United States respondents agreeing with the proposition \"a university education is more important for a boy than for a girl\" decreased from about 14% in the period between 1994 and 1999 to about about 9% in the period between 2005 and 2007. Similarly, the number of people who agreed with \"when jobs are scarce, men should have more right to a job than women\" decreased from 19% to about 8% over the same period.\nThe report cites current research from the United States and England showing the more education a mother has, the better the outcomes for her children will be.\nCurrently in the United States, females academically outperform their male counterparts in all academic areas including [[mathematics|math] and [[science]]. On the math test though, US boys tested better than US girls by a score of roughly 495 to 480. US girls outperform boys on the literacy test with mean scores of approximately 510 to 490. In this regard, the report suggests US girls' performance patterns resemble global ones. \n[[Mali]]'s percentage of girls in primary school is equivalent to the United States in 1810 at around 34%. Burkino Faso is worse, matching the United States in 1780 with a percentage of roughly 25%.

For Fiji, the report focused on progress being made in the country as it relates to gender roles and the local impact of the .\nGirls from Fiji believe they can attain a university education. In contrast, boys from rural areas in Fiji generally do not believe they will stay in school past the level. The report attributes this to the need for boys to contribute to the family income. This pushes them out of school and into the workforce. \nIt also says girls have less free time than boys. Girls have specific household chores that limit their free time. Boys, in contrast, have fewer structured household tasks, and the tasks they do have require less time. Boys also have greater ability to leave the house than girls. The report says these differences play a role in defining gender roles. This can lead boys into engaging in bad behavior and increase their exposure to and alcohol. The report says this pattern exists elsewhere in countries like Yemen, Sudan, Bhutan, India, the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Dominican Republic, Tanzania, Burkina Faso, Liberia, and Papua New Guinea. The report quotes a Fijian boy as saying, \"Boys, they take their bikes and scoot off and roam around in villages here and there\".\nFijian girls are beginning to challenge these traditional cultural gender norms. While they acknowledge and admire the hard work their mothers have done in the domestic sphere, they seek better education and opportunities.\nWhile the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in 1979, Fiji did not ratify it until August 1995. They were the 139th country to do so. At first, Fiji objected for cultural reasons to one part of CEDAW, and said sections containing different rules for men and women on their ability to marry foreigners was incompatible with another part. \nThese objections were eventually dropped and constitutional changes were made between 1997 and 1999. CEDAW helped bring about family law reform in 1995. A civil uprising in 2000 stalled some iniatives, but the 2002 CEDAW review assisted in reviving efforts. In 2009, the minimum age allowed for both men and women to marry was raised to 18 years.\nSince the introduction of CEDAW, reforms have been made that allowed for more equal partners, make divorces easier to get, make it harder for women to be excluded from the home, and improve the amount, and enforced the payment, of spousal support and following a divorce. The report notes that a 2010 review of CEDAW said there is still room for improvement in terms of inheritance rights for women.\nFiji has a population of 854,000, with an annual average percentage population growth of 0.6%. 31% of the population is aged 0 to 14. The average life expectancy for men is 67 years and for women is 71 years."}

The report noted relatively high numbers of women participating in Finnish politics, and credited the Council for Equality between Men and Women in Finland with progress.\nFinland bucks the global trend; the report notes globally \"the number of women holding parliamentary seats is very low, and progress in the last 15 years has been slow.\" Female representation in national parliaments has risen from 10% in 1995 to 17% in 2009. By contrast, Finnish female parliamentarians accounted for 38.5% of new members in 1991, rising to 42.5% in 2011. Finland was one of just nine nations whose total female cabinet members stood at more than 40% in 2008. Globally, females accounted for 17% of ministers, representing a rise from just 8% in 1998.\nAlthough not specifically mentioned by the report, since the millennium the positions of and have both been held by women; Tarja Halonen became the nation's first female President in 2000 and in 2010 was selected to be the second female Prime Minister. Women gained suffrage in 1906 with little opposition, ahead of the US and UK.\nThe cross-party Council for Equality between Men and Women in Finland dates back to the 1970s; the World Bank dismisses its role at that time as \"primarily symbolic\" with little in the way of staff, funding, or influence. In the 1980s it was handed statutory power for gender equality issues and has gone on to press for reforms in areas including , job training, and quotas on political representation. The report calls the council a \"success\". \nEducation, however, showed gender segregation by subject at the tertiary level; Finland was one of several countries singled out as examples of high gender segregation in economically developed countries, compared to lower levels of segregation in less well-developed nations. Finland is one of the four members of the with the highest segregation by subject alongside Croatia, Japan, and Lithuania.\nFinland has very high levels of education enrollment for both boys and girls, at almost 100% at level. Females are ahead of men in tertiary education enrollment, with 46% of men in the relevant age group enrolling in 1991 and 52% of women. By 2009 these numbers stood at 82% and 101% respectively.\nBoys and girls were neck and neck with high scores in their 2009 maths tests, both averaging around 540. Literacy also produced very high scores but with a gender gap; boys averaged around 510 while girls averaged around 560.\nInternet access in Finland is high with men slightly ahead; for men and women alike access stands at around 85%. Finns have a legal right to a 1Mbps broadband connection and authorities plan to have 100Mbps connections for every citizen by 2015. The proportion of women at least 25% of the time has risen from around 7% in 2000\u20131 to 9% in 2005; the male figure was at 9% in 2005 and is now 15\u201320%. Rapid teleworking growth is a global trend but the report notes the female figures generally grew faster.\nMarketplace activities also show gender disparity in Finland. Of activities performed by men and women, the female share stands at 41%, versus 63% for domestic activities such as housework. From 2006\u20139 services accounted for 87% of female and 56% of male employment. 10% of women and 37% of men were employed in industry and agriculture was only a minor employer, with 6% of male employment and 3% of female employment.\nLife expectancy for Finnish men has risen from 71 years in 1990 to 77 years in 2009; in the same period, women's life expectancy increased from 79 years to 83 years.

The culture secretary said Tuesday in the House of Commons the proposal by the newspaper industry failed to implement fundamental parts of the recommendations of the Leveson Inquiry into behaviour and ethical standards of the press last year.\nMiller announced the final draft of the Charter will become availble on Friday following revisions by the political parties, and will be discussed by the on October 30. The proposals offered by the newspapers and the government differ on implementation details on the regulator that would replace the . The newspapers wish to allow former editors of newspapers to serve on the \"recognition panel\" which would supervise the operation of the regulator while the government wishes to forbid former editors. The government wish to prevent serving newspaper editors from being on the appointments committee for the regulator while the press proposal seeks to require one of the four members of the committee to represent the press industry.\nThe government proposal seeks to make it so the Royal Charter can be amended by Parliament, with a two-thirds majority from both houses, while the press proposal gives industry trade bodies a say on changes to the Charter. In both proposals, an arbitration service would be provided as an alternative to going to court, but the government wishes to make the arbitration service free for claimants while the newspapers want it to be \"inexpensive\" because they believe free arbitration could lead to a rush in claims going to arbitration. Both proposals would allow the regulator to fine the industry up to 1 million and demand the prominent publication of corrections and apologies to news stories.\nThe campaign welcomed the rejection of the industry proposals. A spokesman described the proposals as \"a wrecking manouevre by unrepentant sections of the press trying to avoid accountability and carry on with a broken system of press regulation\" but condemned the delays in implementation: \"Ten months after the publication of the Leveson Report and seven months after all parties in parliament endorsed its recommendations in a Royal Charter, there can be no legitimate excuse for yet another delay.\"\nHacked Off was formed following the revelations in 2011 that journalists working for the Sunday tabloid \"News of the World\" hacked into the voicemail of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler.\nThe newspaper industry continue to express concern regarding the proposals. Trevor Kavanagh, a columnist for the \"\", said that the \"major issue here is keeping the freedom of the press out of the sticky fingers of the politicians who want to control it\". \nKirsty Hughes from said: \"Establishing press regulation by royal charter could allow politicians to interfere in press regulation and threaten media freedom in the UK.\"\nMovie actor , a director of Hacked Off, rejected criticism of the charter from the press, arguing the press object to the system because \"when the press gets things wrong and harms people unfairly, the charter system will give those people a much better chance of redress. It will provide free or at least very cheap arbitration, instead of requiring people whose rights have been breached to pay mountainous high court legal bills. And it will provide a free, independent complaints service in the case of breaches of the industry code of standards.\" \nGrant goes on to argue that the press have attempted to reform the \"old, discredited\" Press Complaints Commission which Lord Leveson had found not fit for purpose. Instead, he argues, the press should welcome the new regulator as a protection from libel as joining in means \"their journalists will have better protection from legal bullying by corporations and oligarchs. Because litigants are pushed towards cheap arbitration it will no longer be possible for the very wealthy to gag reporters simply by threatening high court actions. The court costs would fall to the libel bully.\""}

The officers claim Mitchell did not disclose the precise words he said during the altercation. A tape by Mitchell has since emerged of this meeting which casts doubt on this claim.\nAn investigation by the IPCC ruled on Tuesday that the officers involved should face gross misconduct proceedings as there was evidence they had deliberately set out to discredit Mitchell.

The conduct of these officers was not acceptable.\"\nNick Clegg said on his radio show it was \"perfectly legitimate for Andrew Mitchell to feel pretty sore\" for the behaviour of the police officers.\nConservative minister told the BBC that David Cameron should reinstate Mitchell. Home Secretary Theresa May said the behaviour of the police in the Mitchell affair threatened the public's trust in the police.\nSir Hugh Orde from the said the chief constables need to be given chance to explain their reasons for not engaging in further disciplinary action: \"It seems to me in this case there is no issue that the finding by the police service was the officers\u2019 behaviour fell below the standard. The question is the quantum of seriousness and I think that's why the chief constables are clearly determined to explain that.\"\nNext week, the chief constables are to appear before the to discuss their decisions."}

All of us first'", "text": "Glasgow \u2014\nLast weekend, December 8, , a left-leaning think-tank, launched \"The Common Weal\", a vision for a more socially just and inclusive post-Independence Scotland. Five- to six-hundred turned up for the event, billed as \"[\"a\"] 'revolution' ... with T-shirts and dancing\" by the \"\", and held in club and theatre, under Glasgow's .\n\"Wikinews\"' Brian McNeil travelled to Glasgow to attend, walking through the city's festively decorated , and busy shopping streets, to the venue under .\nMore known for theatre, live music, and club nights, organisers in The Arches confirmed around 800 had signed up for the free Sunday afternoon event. The crowd was a mix of all ages, including families with young childen. Stuart Braithwaite of entertained the early arrivals by DJ-ing until the launch video for the Common Weal was screened.\n\"The Common Weal\" present themselves as \"an emerging movement which is developing a vision for economic and social development in Scotland which is distinct and different from the political orthodoxy that dominates politics and economics in London.\" Contrasting current \"me first politics\" against concerns of ordinary Scots, the launch video's opening, monochrome half, stresses everyday common concerns: \"Will I have a pension I can survive on when I retire?\", \"I miss my local library\", \"Public transport is so bad it's hard to get to work\"; and, \"Why can we always find money to bail out banks but not to protect public services?\", \"Why is it always the poor, the disabled, and immigrants who get the blame?\"\nThe preferred vision offered by the Common Weal, \"Not me first, all of us first\", makes up the more-aspirational second-half of the film, advocating a national fund for industry, taking the nation's energy into collective ownership, building quality new public housing, strengthening the welfare state, and ending tax evasion. Throughout the event a distinction between these 'popular politics', which experience wide support, and the derogatory 'populist' label, often used to dismiss such calls for a fairer society, was emphasised.\nComedienne took over following the film, to the afternoon, and introduce Reid Foundation director Robin McAlpine. With the mixed audience, Godley made avoiding profanity \u2014 due to the presence of children \u2014 a theme of her warm-up; although, the humour remained fairly adult in nature.\nMcAlpine sketched out the movement's hopes and plans. After thanking those who were giving their time for free, he characterised modern politics as \"[...] a game that is played by a small number of professionals, in a small number of rooms, in a small number of expensively-rented premises, across Scotland \u2014 and across Britain. It's become a thing people do as a profession, and the rest of us are all supposed to applaud them \u2014 or stand back \u2014 nod our heads every four years, and be glad for it.\" With a receptive audience, he continued: \"The idea that politics is something that ordinary people talk about is one of the great achievements of the right-wing [over] the last thirty to forty years in Britain\"; remarking, to applause, \"they scared us .\" \nOn discussions around the country, he claimed that \"across Scottish politics, [...] the people that want this, ... 'me first' politics, there's not many of them. The people that want Common Weal politics, all of us first politics, I'm meeting them everywhere. [...] Everyone I meet wants this, a decent politics that puts people first. [...] We wanted to find a way to communicate an idea of a politics which work for all the people who those politics seek to govern, not just a few of them. People don't understand or recognise the language of politics any more, so we want to change that language.\".\nCrediting the \"Sunday Herald\" newspaper for an opportunity to share some ideas underpinning the Common Weal, McAlpine was scathing in his criticism of mainstream coverage of the independence debate: \"There's this massive debate. It's not in the mainstream.\" Seeking to \"get a real debate going, about a really strong vision for a future for Scotland, it's hard. They're still doing , accounting this, and another paper from a Whitehall that. And, we'll all debate things that nobody really cares about, interminably, until they all go away for good.\" On the current political debate, he remarked: \"If mainstream politics fails to recognise what is really going on in Scotland just now, then that is its problem. [...] Someone is going to offer ordinary people what they want, and when they do, everything will change.\"\nUrging the crowd to get involved, he said: \"If we can create a popular politics, that ordinary people care about, and talk about, and work[s], we can take a grip of Scotland. We can decide the future politics of Scotland, and standing around waiting for professional politicians to... disappoint us less than they always do, does not have to be the way we do this anymore.\" He concluded, \"It genuinely is time for a politics that puts all of us first.\"\nJaney Godley took the microphone, as McAlpine left the stage to cheers and applause; joking about the 'rabble-rousing' tone of the speech she then introduced David Whyte of Tangent Design, creator of the Common Weal's logo.\nWhyte explained they hoped the simple image would come to represent the \"all of us first\" philosophy, and \"a new way of doing things\". He was not the first to jokingly remark that the four-line graphic \u2014 a triangle, with a balanced line on top of it \u2014 would be an easily-applied piece of graffiti.\nPolitics, and the launch of the movement's logo, then took more of a back-seat; the rest of the event more in-keeping with having a party, and the festive decorations elsewhere around the city centre. Godley, and fellow Scottish joker Bruce Morton, provided more barbed comedy. Singer Karine Polwart encouraged the crowd to sing along to a song she said was written on her way to the party, and Actor Tam Dean Burn read a speech from the 16th century Scottish play \"Satire of the three estates\" \u2014 given by the character John Common Weal, representing the common man \u2014 where the deeds and behaviour of the ruling classes are such that, if done by a common man, they'd be hanged.\nScotland's is to take place next year, September 18. This was a repeated election pledge of the Scottish National Party (SNP) \u2014 who moved from leading a minority government, to an outright majority in the \u2014 making good on their promise by announcing in January 2011 their intent to hold the referendum in autumn 2014.\nThe question being put to the electorate is: \"Should Scotland be an independent country?\" A \"Yes\" vote would be followed with negotiations to bring to an end the early eighteenth-century \". The SNP has proposed Scotland retain Elizabeth II as head of state, a position she holds on the basis of the century-earlier ."}

He was required to serve the rest of the 2002 sentence and stay in prison till 2029. \nAs a protest against the punishment, Issawi began a publicized hunger strike. For more than 260 days he was fed water, vitamins, and additional materials only by infusion. Consequentially, his medical condition deteriorated and became critical. According to the Los Angeles Times, Israel decided to start a negotiation lest Issawi's death in the Israeli prison cause violence from the Palestinians in the . In the end, Issawi agreed to stay in the Israeli prison for an additional eight months to serve the administrative arrest he was under and in exchange he stopped his hunger strike."}

Or was that a later one?\n The Gliders have never won the World Championship.\n Unfortunately, they are talking about moving it so it will be on the year before the Paralympics.\n The competition from the [] World Cup and all.\n But anyway, it is on next year, in June.

There's two \u2014 yourself and \u2014 who have retired. wasn't selected, but they had back, so there was ten old players and only two new ones. \n Caitlin de Wit.\n No, she's missed out again.\n That doesn't mean that she won't make the team... \n You never know until they finally announce it.\n They said to me that they expected a couple of people to get sick in Bangkok. And they did. \n They sort of budgeted for three players each from the men's and women's teams to be sick.\n Yeah. I sort of took to counting the Gliders like sheep so I knew \"Okay, we've only go ten, so who's missing?\" \n She was sick the whole time. And Caitlin and Georgia were a bit off as well. \n The change of diet affects some people.\n When was that?\n 2007 or 2008?\n Yeah, well, the men are going to for their world championship, while the women go to Toronto. And of course the next Paralympics is in .\n It will be a very different climate and very different food.\n One of the things that struck me about the Australian team \u2014 I hadn't seen the Gliders before London. It was an amazing experience seeing you guys come out on the court for the first time at the Marshmallow...\n It was probably all old hat to you guys. You'd been practicing for months. Certainly since in July.\n Especially that last night there at the . There were thirteen thousand people there. They opened up some extra parts of the stadium. I could not even see the top rows. They were in darkness.\n When I saw you last you were in Sydney and you said you were moving down to Melbourne. Why was that?\n I know you lived here for a long time, but you moved up to Sydney. Did your teacher's degree up there. \n And you like teaching?\n You retired just after the Paralympics.\n Your basketball career or your teaching career? \n When did you join them for the first time?\n That would be good.\n Where are they all at?\n It's not really because...\n Yeah, they kept on pointing that out...\n Sounds like a basketball player already.\n Something I noticed in the crowd in London. People seemed to think that they were in the chair all the time and were surprised when most of the Rollers got up out of their chairs at the end of the game.\n Disability is a very complicated thing. \n I was surprised myself at people who were always in a chair, but yet can wiggle their toes. \n Also talking to the classifiers and they mentioned the people playing [wheelchair] basketball who have no disability at all but are important to the different teams, that carry their bags and stuff. \n Getting women to play sport, whether disabled or not, is another story. And there seems to be a reluctance amongst women to participate in sports, particularly sports that they regard as being men's sports.\n They would much rather play a sport that is a women's sport. \n Where is it?\n How does Victoria compare with New South Wales?\n At the moment you'll notice a large contingent of Gliders from .\n The news recently has been taking over the running of things. The Gliders now have a full time coach.\n I'm sure he is.\n Did you do some work with him?\n Watching the Gliders and the Rollers... with the Rollers, they can do it. With the Gliders... much more drama from the Gliders in London. For a time we didn't even know if they were going to make the finals. Lost that game against Canada.\n Apparently.\n You said you played over 100 [international] games. By our count there was 176 before you went to London, plus two games there makes 178 international caps. Which is more than some teams that you played against put together. \n You need to prove it.\n Before every game in London there was an announcement that at the World Championships and the Paralympics \"they have never won\".\n You were in the final game in 2004.\n What was it like?\n The best team on the court on the day. \n I'd like to see that happen. I'd really like to see them win. In Toronto, apparently, because the Canadian men are not in the thing, the Canadians are going to be focusing on their women's team. They apparently didn't take their best team and their men were knocked out by Columbia or Mexico or something like that. \n And in the women's competition there's teams like Peru. But I remember in London that Gliders were wrong-footed by Brazil, a team that they had never faced before. Nearly lost that game. \n They'll definitely be an interesting side when it comes to Rio.\n They're a tough team too.\n The Germans lost to the Americans in the final in Beijing.\n And between 2008 and 2012 all they talked about was the US, and a rematch against the US. But of course when it came to London, they didn't face the US at all, because you guys knocked the US out of the competition.\n You won by a point.\n It went down to a final shot. There was a chance that the Americans would win the thing with a shot after the siren. Well, a buzzer-beater. \n Thankyou very much for this."}

USI's art gallery, like 189 other educational galleries and museums around the country, is a recipient of a major Warhol donor program, and this program is cultivating new interest in Warhol's photographic legacy. \"Wikinews\" reporters attended the opening and spoke to donors, exhibit organizers and patrons.\nThe USI art gallery celebrated the Thursday opening with its display of Warhol's Polaroids, gelatin silver prints and several colored screen prints. USI's exhibit, which is located in Evansville, Indiana, is to run from January 23 through March 9.\nThe McCutchan Art Center/Pace Galleries at USI bases its exhibit around roughly 100 Polaroids selected from its collection. The Polaroids were all donated by the Andy Warhol Photographic Legacy Program, according to Kristen Wilkins, assistant professor of photography and curator of the exhibit. The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts made two donations to USI Art Collections, in 2007 and a second recently. \nKathryn Waters, director of the gallery, expressed interest in further donations from the foundation in the future.\nSince 2007 the Andy Warhol Photographic Legacy Program has seeded university art galleries throughout the United States with over 28,000 photographs and other artifacts. The program takes a decentralized approach to Warhol's photography collection and encourages university art galleries to regularly disseminate and educate audiences about Warhol's artistic vision, especially in the area of photography.\nUniversity exhibits.\n\"Wikinews\" provides additional video, audio and photographs so our readers may learn more.\nWilkins observed that the 2007 starting date of the donation program, which is part of the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, coincided with the 20th anniversary of Andy Warhol's death in 1987. USI was not alone in receiving a donation.\nK.C. Maurer, chief financial officer and treasurer at the Andy Warhol Foundation, said 500 institutions received the initial invitation and currently 190 universities have accepted one or more donations. Institutional recipients, said Mauer, are required to exhibit their donated Warhol photographs every ten years as one stipulation.\nWhile USI is holding its exhibit, there are also Warhol Polaroid exhibits at the Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery at in , and an and Andy Warhol exhibit at the Mary &amp; Leigh Block Museum of Art at in , . All have received Polaroids from the foundation. \nUniversity exhibits can reach out and attract large audiences. For example, the Weatherspoon Art Museum at the saw attendance levels reach 11,000 visitors when it exhibited its Warhol collection in 2010, according to curator Elaine Gustafon. That exhibit was part of a collaboration combining the collections from , located in , North Carolina, and , which also were recipients of donated items from the Andy Warhol Photographic Legacy Program.\nSuperstars.\nEach collection donated by the Andy Warhol Photographic Legacy Program holds Polaroids of well-known celebrities. The successful UNC Greensboro exhibit included Polaroids of author and singer-songwriter .\n\"I think America's obsession with celebrity culture is as strong today as it was when Warhol was living\", said Gustafon. \"People are still intrigued by how stars live, dress and socialize, since it is so different from most people's every day lives.\"\nWilkins explained Warhol's obsession with celebrities began when he first collected head shots as a kid and continued as a passion throughout his life. \"He's hanging out with the celebrities, and has kind of become the same sort of celebrity he was interested in documenting earlier in his career\", Wilkins said.\nThe exhibit at USI includes Polaroids of actor ; musician of ; publishers of ' and of '; disco club owner of ; photographers , and ; and athletes (tennis) and (golf). \n\"Wikinews\" observed the USI exhibit identifies and features Polaroids of fashion designer , a former resident of Evansville.\nUniversity collections across the United States also include Polaroids of \"unknowns\" who have not yet had their fifteen minutes of fame. Cynthia Thompson, curator and director of exhibits at the , , said, \"These images serve as documentation of people in his every day life and art \u2014 one which many of us enjoy a glimpse into.\"\nWarhol's photographic legacy.\nWarhol was close to important touchstones of the 1960s, including art, music, consumer culture, fashion, and celebrity worship, which were all buzzwords and images \"Wikinews\" observed at USI's opening exhibit. \nHe was also an influential figure in the pop art movement. \"Pop art was about what popular American culture really thought was important\", Kathryn Waters said. \"That's why he did the cans or the pictures, these iconic products of American culture whether they be in film, video or actually products we consumed. So even back in the sixties, he was very aware of this part of our culture. Which as we all know in 2014, has only increased probably a thousand fold.\"\n\"I think everybody knows Andy Warhol's name, even non-art people, that's a name they might know because he was such a personality\", Water said. \nHilary Braysmith, USI associate professor of art history, said, \"I think his photography is equally influential as his graphic works, his more famous pictures of Marilyn. In terms of the evolution of photography and experimentation, like painting on them or the celebrity fascination, I think he was really ground-breaking in that regard.\"\nThe Polaroid format is not what made Warhol famous, however, he is in the company of other well-known photographers who used the camera, such as , , , , and .\nWilkins said, \"[Warhol] liked the way photo booths and the Polaroid's front flash looked\". She explained how Warhol's adoption of the Polaroid camera revealed his process. According to Wilkins, Warhol was able to reproduce the Polaroid photograph and create an enlargement of it, which he then could use to commit the image to the silk screen medium by applying paint or manipulating them further. One of the silk screens exhibited at USI this time was the screen print called \"Cowboys and Indians\" from 1987.\nWilkins also said Warhol was both an artist and a businessperson. \"As a way to commercialize his work, he would make a blue Marilyn and a pink Marilyn and a yellow Marilyn, and then you could pick your favorite color and buy that.

Why did she so badly want to attend? \"It's Warhol. He is a legend.\" \nFor Kevin Allton, a USI instructor in English, Warhol was also a legend. He said, \"Andy Warhol was the center of the Zeitgeist for the 20th century and everything since. He is a post-modern diety.\"\nAllton said he had only seen the Silver Clouds installation before in film. The Silver Clouds installation were silver balloons blown up with helium, and those balloons filled one of the smaller rooms in the gallery. \"I thought that in real life it was really kind of magical,\" Allton said. \"I smacked them around.\"\nElements of the Zeitgeist were also playfully recreated on USI's opening night. In her opening remarks for attendees, Waters pointed out those features to attendees, noting the touches of the Warhol Factory, or the studio where he worked, that were present around them. She pointed to the refreshment table with served with \"electric\" and tables adorned with colorful gumball \"pills\". The music in the background was from such bands as .\nThe big hit of the evening, \"Wikinews\" observed from the long line, was the Polaroid-room where attendees could wear a Warhol-like wig or don crazy glasses and have their own Polaroid taken. The Polaroids were ready in an instant and immediately displayed at the entry of the exhibit. Exhibit goers then became part of the very exhibit they had wanted to attend. In fact, many people \"Wikinews\" observed took out their as they left for the evening and used their own phone cameras to make one further record of the moment \u2014 a photo of a photo. Perhaps they had learned an important lesson from the Warhol exhibit that cultural events like these were ripe for use and reuse. We might even call these exit instant snap shots, the self selfie."}

With the discovery of a body today \"Wikinews\" has found evidence suggesting media has been caught out by Scottish contempt of court law.\nThe notes the differences. \"...dock identification is a more important part of court procedure [in Scotland] and therefore pictures of the accused cannot be published until the trial is over. Scottish judges consider it contempt to publish pictures of the accused.\" Despite this, many sources, including the BBC, have named a person detained by police and published their photograph. The BBC did this online, in addition to naming the detained individual on Radio 4.\nOur correspondent is based in Scotland and has been advised by a lawyer not to identify anybody detained until they have appeared in court, even if they have been arrested and charged. The Contempt of Court Act 1981 is designed to prevent prejudicial material going in front of juries before trial. Although UK-wide legislation, the law is interpreted differently north of the border than in .\nThe BBC College of Journalism advises Scottish legal advice be sought before publishing images of the accused. Channel 4's Producer's Handbook notes \"the law has tended to be interpreted more strictly in Scotland\" but does not advise on how so. Images of arrested persons in high-profile cases are often published in cases south of the border.\nChannel 4 is also amongst organisations to have named the detained person and put an image of them online. Police announced last night that a body believed to be the missing child had been found in and that an individual had been detained. The boy had been missing since Thursday morning although there was a possible sighting of him then. Hundreds of volunteers have assisted police searching the Scottish capital for the boy.\n\"Wikinews\" has also found the following organisations publishing material that may prove problematic as the case becomes a major media story.\nSome Scottish publications have also been publishing similar material.\nThe articles rank amongst the most-read items on many of the news websites. Unlike in England and Wales, where only the Attorney General can prosecute contempt of this sort, in Scotland the media organisations can be charged by an accused person. Wikinewsies in Scotland have noted remarks made about the named person's alleged wrongdoing on public transport and Facebook, suggesting widespread knowledge of their identity.\nSeveral of the organisations involved are no stranger to being prosecuted for contempt over cases in neighbouring England. In 2011 \"The Sun\" and \"The Daily Mail\" were successfully prosecuted for contempt by Dominic Grieve after they published a photo of a murder defendant posing with a gun. The case did not involve firearms and Grieve spoke of \"seriously impeded or prejudiced\" proceedings if any jurors saw the photos. The trial was not stopped as the photo was removed from circulation before the jury saw it and the defendant was found guilty.\nIn 2011 \"The Sun\" and \"Mirror\" were fined for reporting negatively about an arrested suspect in the high-profile . Chris Jeffries, landlord of the victim, was subsequently released from police custody and proved to be entirely innocent. Jeffries also pursued action against a number of publications. Politicians subsequently considered a law banning the naming of arrested persons who have not been charged throughout the UK as a direct result of this case.\n\"The Daily Mail\" and \"Mirror\" were back in court the next year for their coverage of a trial involving serial killer . The two papers were again fined after Dominic Grieve told the High Court in London of an \"avalanche\" of \"seriously prejudicial\" stories. The papers published their stories after Bellfield was convicted of abducting and murdering schoolgirl . The trial was not yet over, however, as the jury was still considering an additional charge relating to another alleged attempted abduction. That charge was dropped because of news coverage.\n\"Wikinews\" is awaiting comment from several prominent Scottish professors of law on the issues raised by this article. "}

Whilst staying in the hotel, the Wikimedian group met two MEPs who chose it in-preference to dramatically more-expensive Strasbourg accommodation. One of the ushers from the parliament also chatted with volunteers at the hotel, self-depricatingly describing his ceremonial attire as a \"penguin suit\" due to the long-tailed jacket.\nOne of the first day's MEPs to introduce themselves to the visiting Wikimedians was ; delivering copies of his book, \"The Case for Copyright Reform\", co-authored with founder .

The second and third days in the parliament saw the highest number of MEPs coming to see the visiting Wikimedians and have their photographs taken.

Indiana's already prohibits same-sex marriage. A sentence banning was removed from the proposal. \nFor a constitutional amendment to be approved in Indiana, it must pass both the and the Senate during two separately elected legislatures, which means there has to be an election between the two sets of votes. The proposed amendment cannot be changed from one voting session to another and cannot be changed from the House of Representatives to the Senate. Once the proposed amendment has passed those hurdles, then the amendment goes to Indiana voters who vote yea or nay on the amendment.\nFollowing the House of Representatives' approval, the Senate passed the proposed amendment, which is known as House Joint Resolution 3, with a vote of 32\u201317 Monday. Opponents needed eight more votes to stop the proposed amendment from reaching the necessary margin of support.\nThe proposed amendment already passed both houses in 2011. A change was made this legislative session when the second sentence was deleted first by the House of Representatives and then was passed in a similar form by the Senate Monday. The failure of the second sentence, which proposes to ban same-sex civil unions, could possibly open the door for civil unions in the future. Following the process, will be reviewed again by the next elected legislature in either 2015 or 2016 to remain in process. \nAlthough the amended version grants the possibility for civil unions in the future, some in the LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) community say it isn't enough. \n\"I think it's still bad because it fails to legitimize us as human beings, since it's trying to deny us basic rights,\u201d said Myranda Wanden, program director at , an organization that provides support and advocacy for LBGT teens and young adults. \nIndiana supported the proposed amendment. Pence, in his \"State of the State\" speech for 2014, said, \u201cI believe in traditional marriage, and I have long held the view that the people, rather than unelected judges, should decide matters of such great consequence\". Pence also called for a civil debate for the matter and to treat everyone with respect. \n\u201cI think the rest of the country is moving towards being more open and accepting about gay marriage,\" Wanden said. \"I think Indiana, which is a conservative red state, saw this and wanted to resist the changing tide. I think it caused fear in many legislators, but I definitely don't think it's reflective of a majority of the Indiana population.\u201d\nIndiana is not the only state that prohibits same-sex marriage by law or as proposed by constitution. There are 29 other states that prohibit same-sex civil marriages under their constitutions, while Indiana and three other states prohibit it by statute. The states that allow for some form of same-sex marriage number 17 plus Washington, DC.\nWorldwide, there is a wide diversity in same-sex marriage and rights laws. At this time, 17 countries allow same-sex marriage, the most recent being Scotland. Most of the countries that allow same-sex marriage are concentrated in Europe, but there are also countries in South America and Africa, as well as New Zealand, Canada, and parts of Mexico that have legalized same-sex marriage. \nHomosexual sex is legally criminal in at least 78 countries, and punishable by death in five."}

His body was found in just before midnight on January 17, and his mother was arrested on January 18. That's when \"Wikinews\" first reported on possible widespread contempt by UK and Scottish media.\nOur correspondent is based in Scotland and has been advised by a lawyer not to identify anybody detained until they have appeared in court, even if they have been arrested and charged. Professor James Chalmers of the University of Glasgow has since reviewed our coverage and confirmed this position. Despite that a large number of major media outlets identified Rosdeep Adekoya, nee Kular, 33, as the arrested individual.\nAdekoya has since been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with murdering her son. She is in custody pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be tainted because her image has been widely published. This is common practice elsewhere in the UK but Scottish justice works differently and courts have viewed publication of photos as potentially prejudicial. Professor Pamela Ferguson of the notes \"journalists do seem to be walking a dangerous line if publishing photos etc of suspects.\" Crown Office, which is in overall charge of prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made at least until indictment.\nMacAskill however expressed confidence in the Scottish court system to deal with the situation. \"I am confident... the courts themselves will intervene if they believe publicity is in danger of being prejudicial.\" He also wrote to Lamont that he has faith in the court to successfully direct any jury that may try the case in order to maintain fairness.\nThe Contempt of Court Act 1981 is designed to prevent prejudicial material going in front of juries before trial. Although UK-wide legislation, the law is interpreted differently north of the border than in . Witnesses in Scotland may be asked to identify accused persons standing in the dock. The advises legal advice be sought ahead of publishing photos and notes it has previously been ruled contempt. The BBC used the accused's photo prominently in their own online coverage.\nChalmers explains: \"It may be a contempt of court to create a substantial risk of serious prejudice to someone's right to a fair trial. A photograph \"might\" do this in a case where identification is an issue; on the face of it, that does not seem especially likely in this case, but it is impossible to know for certain at this point. The courts have said that the only safe route to avoid committing a contempt is to avoid publishing a photograph, but that does not mean that publishing a photograph is automatically a contempt.\" MacAskill noted \"the kind of issue that publicity might raise may become apparent only during the trial itself.\"\nContempt has been a considerable issue in the UK in recent years after high-profile cases. In one instance a charge against serial killer was dropped owing to publicity while the jury were deliberating; in another, newspapers were fined and sued for over reporting on the arrest of a suspect who turned out to be innocent in a prominent investigation.\nA proposal was mooted to ban identification of suspects arrested anywhere in the UK, but this was subsequently shelved. MacAskill confirmed \"the Scottish Government is content with the way the courts are operating the rules on contempt of court in Scotland at the moment and has no plans to make changes.\" He also wrote of the difficulties with trying to individually cover all eventualities with prescriptive legislation, saying \"A trial for a sexual offence will raise very different issues \u2014 particularly of protecting victims \u2014 from those that are raised by a tax fraud trial.\" \nMacAskill says it is the Scottish Government's position that the task of \"counterbalancing the public interest in reporting with upholding the criminal law should be left to those whose job it is to do so \u2014 the courts and the judiciary, acting in the individual circumstances of the case\"."}

The initially separate teams looked at different plasmodium species. One, an international group led by Manuel Llin\u00e1s of in the US, examined ', which is responsible for the worst form of human malarial infections; the other, led by UK scientists Oliver Billker from the in England and Andy Waters from in Scotland, looked at ', which infects rodents.\nThe \"P. falciparum\" group was kickstarted by research in Spain which found different organisms from the same with identical had varying levels of AP2-G, with a strong to their levels of sexual activity. The more AP2-G, the higher the rate of gametocyte formation. Researchers in England, later also drawn into the international team, analyzed the of two mutated strains of \"P. falciparum\" which were both unable to form gametocytes. They found that the gene responsible for producing the AP2-G protein was the only common non-functioning gene. \nThe international team found found the AP2-G protein catalyzes the transmission by activating a relevant gene set in the parasite. \nBoth teams confirmed the finding by \u2014 both by adding the gene into a mutated strain and observing its ability to form gametocytes, and the other way round.\nThe parasites exist in a mosquito, then in a human, and require subsequent transmission for the parasite to spread.

The parasite triggers formation of the sexual gametocytes into the human's circulatory system every two days in small quantities \u2014 not wasting energy on the process at the dry time of year when few mosquitoes are available \u2014 but little was known about the mechanism.\nDr. Oliver Billker commented on the potential of getting the transmission of malaria under control, unlike the existing focus on addressing the phrase causing the clinical symptoms, \"Current drugs treat patients by killing the sexless form of the parasite in their blood \u2014 this is the detrimental stage of the malaria lifecycle that causes illness. However, it is now widely accepted that to eliminate malaria from an entire region, it will be equally important to kill the sexual forms that transmit the disease.\" \nThe researchers hope to continue research toward drugs to prevent the transmission of the disease.

Both teams did a full line change within the first minute of play following an Italian penalty by Bruno Balossetti that resulted in a United States power player. While the USA got possession on the penalty, it was after a few seconds where who had possession was questionable. The puck then changed possession several times. Both goalies had to work in the opening minutes of the game. With 12:20 left in the first, Italy had a fast break down the ice. In defending his goal, the Team USA goalie fell over and there was a mob in front of the goal trying to move the puck. The USA managed to prevent the Italians from scoring. Following this, there was a line change and a similar pile up in front of the Team USA net at 12:13. After a penalty that saw Andy Yohe get 2 minutes for roughing, the United States got possession.\nBoth sides had their fans in arena, with several large Italian flags behind their team's bench. There were a pair of United States flags. When the Italians had the puck and looked likely to score, the multitude of Russian flags were waved and the fans cheered in support of the team. The United States allowed Italy to get possession after two players crashed into each other and had to untangle their sledges. At 10:20 left, Italy managed to get a shot on goal, which the USA goalie stopped. With 10:09, both teams were to full strength. There was another pile up, this time in front of the Italian net, at 9:12 left. The United States had problems passing during much of this time, and with keeping the puck out of their third. A United States fan was screaming at the team at one point shouting, \"Get it out.\" Italy had several good chances but they were not able to capitalize on them. At 2:30 left, the United States and Italy were about equal with shots on goal: 4 for USA, 5 for Italy. At 2:30 left in the first, Valerio Corvino of Italy got 2 minutes in the penalty box for roughing.

Immediately following the goal, Italian Werner Winkler got a 2 minute penalty for roughing. The pace of the game slowed down in the final minutes, and there were fewer hits. The occasional United States fan chanted \"USA, USA, USA.\" The first period ended 1\u20130 in favour of the United States.\nThe second period started with lots of Italian cheering from the stands, while the Americans possessed the puck on the Italian third of the ice. Both teams were shorthanded, each with a player in the penalty box. The penalties were over and both teams were at full strength by 14:10 left in the second. Early in the period, Italy got a two minute penalty for too many players on the ice. The United States also addressed possession problems they had in the first period and kept the puck in front of the Italian goal. Team USA still had problems with executing passes though. Whenever the Italians got possession of the puck and looked like they might have a remote chance of scoring, the Russian fans started cheering loudly. With 3:48 left in the second, Brody Roybal scored with an assist from Declan Farmer. With 1:18 left in the second, Guiseppe Condello got a 2 minute penalty for teeing when he rammed the front of his sledge into a USA player's sledge. The period ended 2\u20130 in favour of the the United States.\nDuring the intermission, a Paralympic presenter went into the audience to talk to Team USA fans in the stands for the screens found on display in the arena. Following a little patter, she asked the fans to do the Team USA chant, which they did. In response to the requested, \"USA! USA! USA!\" chant, a number of people inside the arena booed.\nThe third period started with Team USA possession. Early in the period, Taylor Chase had a 2 minute penalty for teeing, and both teams were shorthanded with 14:38 left in the third. Italy was back at full strength by 14:17. Despite the teeing penalty, the number of collisions appeared down from earlier in the game. Both teams were at full strength with 12:33 left in the third period. With 11:56 left in the third, Joshua Sweeney got the puck, moved it down the ice and then slid it past the Italian goalkeeper to score an unassisted goal. Midway through the third period, and most of the puck possession took place on the Italian third of the ice. With 4:42 left in the third, with assists from Joshua Pauls and Nikko Landeros, Brody Roybal scored on the Italians to little applause from people in the arena. The score was 4\u20130. Following the goal, Team USA took a timeout and made a goalkeeper change, with Steve Cash out and Jen Lee in. With 3:26 left in the third, Team USA player Paul Schaus earned a 2 minute penalty for roughing. The Team USA goalie made a fantastic above-the-head glove save with 3:05 left in the third. With 1:26 left in the game, Italian Florian Planker scored off an assist from Gianluca Cavaliere. The stadium erupted into loud chanting, and lots of waving of Russian flags. Adam Page was injured with 1:08 left in the game, and left the ice to a round of applause from the fans. The United States's Paul Schaus scored off an assist from Nikko Landeros with just under 5 seconds left in the game, bringing the final score to 5\u20131.\nThe United States comes into Sochi as previous Paralympic gold medalists, having won it at all at the 2010 Winter Paralympics in Vancouver, .

Mafarja was under 18 at the time of the attack. He placed the device on the bus after rejecting several others he rode on as insufficiently crowded, according to the prosecution. He then left the bus and phoned a co-conspirator, who detonated it remotely.\nMafarja was convicted on his own plea last December in a deal which spared him a possible life sentence by dropping a charge of aiding an enemy at a time of war. The bombing was during a brief war between Israel and Gaza and was designed to convince the Israel Defence Forces to withdraw. Later that day an unrelated ceasefire was brokered by Egypt.\nThe sentence was the highest allowed by the deal. Laviv Habib, representing Mafarja, cited the defendant's young age, and his guilty pleas, in mitigation. He also said the device was a \"weak bomb\" not designed to kill but acknowledged his client's actions were \"not simple\" and Mafarja understood fatalities were possible.\nMafarja admitted offences of causing an explosion, conducting an act with intent to aid the enemy, attempted murder, and causing serious bodily harm. Of Palestinian origin, he gained Israeli residency as part of a family reunion programme. After the bombing he returned to his job at a McDonald's in , after catching a train.\nOther alleged members of Mafarja's cell, which was based in the and Ramallah areas, have been indicted. Prosecutors claim political assassinations and suicide attacks were planned. Palestinian Ahmed Moussa, a West Bank resident, is presently on trial over the bus bombing; he is accused of triggering the device. Mohammed Assi was shot dead by Israeli authorities during an attempted arrest. A fourth suspect, Ahmad Salah Ahmad Musa, 25 and of Beit Likya, was indicted in January."}

Crow is widely known for leading numerous strikes by workers that led to disruption of public transport services in the United Kingdom.\nAfter leaving school at 16, Crow started working on the London Underground fixing railway lines and felling trees. He joined a union shortly afterwards. In 1991, Crow was elected assistant general secretary of the RMT. Following the death of in 2002, he was made general secretary. Under his leadership, the union's membership numbers increased by more than a quarter, to 80,000 workers.\nThe current Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said in a statement: \"I'm shocked. Bob Crow was a fighter and a man of character. Whatever our political differences, and there were many, this is tragic news. Bob fought tirelessly for his beliefs and for his members.\"\nThe current Labour Party leader, Ed Miliband said in a statement: \"Bob Crow was a major figure in the labour movement and was loved and deeply respected by his members. I didn't always agree with him politically but I always respected his tireless commitment to fighting for the men and women in his union. He did what he was elected to do, was not afraid of controversy and was always out supporting his members across the country. He was a passionate defender of and campaigner for safe, affordable public transport and was a lifelong anti-fascist activist.\"\nFormer Mayor of London Ken Livingstone praised Crow, in a remark to Sky News: \"He fought really hard for his members. The only working-class people who still have well-paid jobs in London are his members.\""}

The construction company said fire broke out at about 2:10pm (0310 ) and appeared to have been caused by a welding accident in the basement of a building.\nAll site workers were evacuated without injury, according to Fire and Rescue NSW Superintendent Ian Krimmer. Large clouds of smoke were continuing to pour out of the building, casting a thick pall of smoke over the city skyline. Some nearby buildings have also been evacuated, including the KPMG building and offices of the Macquarie Bank.\nFirefighters reported concern about a tower crane overhanging the building basement site. There were fears that the crane could buckle due to the heat and collapse. Firefighters were working to keep the base of the crane cool, and the stability of the structure was being monitored with lasers.\nThe motorway was closed to traffic, and Sydney Harbour Bridge partly closed. There had been major disruptions in traffic and multiple roads in the Sydney CBD (Central Business District) were gridlocked. People catching buses were advised to expect long delays."}

All sixteen on board died when the aircraft went down off the Scottish coast.\nAfter a hearing in Aberdeen, Derek Pyle found failed to remove a component after a metal shard was found. The shard suggested spalling, or the shedding of metal particles in the aircraft's gearbox. \"The size and shape of the particle found [...] were consistent with an advanced stage of classic spalling\" according to the inquiry's findings.\nA week before the crash Bond mulled partially replacing the gearbox. The aircraft went down after the gearbox failed in flight. Pyle found a failure in communication between Bond and helicopter manufacturer had led to the decision not to replace the gearbox.\nThe routine flight was taking oil workers back to Aberdeen from the Miller offshore oil platform, owned by . The aircraft radioed to inform they were twenty minutes from but six seconds later was confronted with an oil warning light and grinding sounds. The crew declared an emergency but the main rotor broke free, which in turn smashed through the tail leaving the aircraft to plunge into the sea. The aircraft crashed within twenty seconds of the first sign of trouble.\nThe inquiry is surrounded by controversy owing to the five-year gap between accident and findings, and the decision by Crown Office not to prosecute over the crash. \"For a criminal prosecution to have taken place, the Crown would have to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt\" a Crown Office statement said on Thursday. \"The Sheriff Principal makes clear that a reasonable doubt remained over the technical cause of the crash\".\nAlthough the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) and Sheriff Pyle found a catastrophic gearbox failure triggered the crash, the exact cause of the failure was never conclusively decided. After hearing expert evidence Pyle found the balance of probabilities pointed to spalling, but could not rule out a manufacturing defect. \nThe inquiry's findings note \"that it would be an extraordinary coincidence if the failure properly to carry out inspection and maintenance of the helicopter\u2019s gearbox was not causative of a catastrophic failure of the same within a matter of days. But, as the evidence made clear, such a coincidence was indeed a possibility.\" Pyle's report added \"the small piece of the helicopter which would have proved the matter beyond any doubt [has] not been recovered from the seabed\".\nBond have released a statement noting \"We have always accepted that we made mistakes through honest confusion over telephone calls and emails.\" Sheriff Pyle found Bond's employees \"tried to carry out their jobs as diligently as they could. All of them impressed me as engineers who well understood the vital importance of their role in ensuring [...] safety\". He also found staff were well-trained and resourced, echoing findings by the AAIB and the .\nPyle noted Bond readily accepted they should have properly followed the maintenance manual and normally did, but \"on one occasion, that fundamental rule was broken\" and the crash was likely a result. Bond, Eurocopter, and investigators all gave evidence.\nTrade unions and victims' families, however, have slammed the decision not to prosecute. While welcoming the FAI's conclusions, victims' lawyer Tom Marshall said the families wanted to review the decision not to prosecute with the , and are also seeking a broader . Audrey Wood, whose son Stuart died in the disaster, said \"How [Crown Office] arrived at that decision [not prosecuting] will haunt us, as not only did we hear of multiple breaches of health and safety, but the decision was also made without all the evidence being present, as vital witness statements had not been given\". \nWood said there were multiple breaches of that could be prosecuted. Crown Office's statement counters \"evidence presented during the FAI has not altered the insufficiency of evidence, therefore the decision not to hold criminal proceedings remains the correct one\". branded their decision a \"travesty of justice\".\nPoliticians have criticised the five-year delay holding the FAI, as has general secretary Grahame Smith who said \"It is vitally important that lessons are learned at the earliest opportunity following tragedies where lives are lost\". Sheriff Pyle himself concluded \"what can, I think, very properly be said is that nearly five years [delay] is on any view far too long and that we all have a responsibility for that. [...] everyone concerned in future fatal accidents involving aircraft of whatever kind should do much better.\"\nLabour have called for new FAI rules; has put a bill before parliament; the Scottish Government says Sheriff Pyle's conclusions are being scrutinised. MSP said the victims' families and North Sea oil workers, who routinely use helicopters, had waited \"far too long\" for the FAI to conclude. \"FAIs should never be delayed so long again.\"\nCrown Office expressed sympathy with the families involved for the delay but blamed the complex nature of the investigation, and pointed out the AAIB, Civil Aviation Authority, and local police had all already conducted their own enquiries. The AAIB spent 30 months investigating.\nTwelve victims were from Scotland, many of those from in and around Aberdeen where the six-week inquiry was held. Three more were from elsewhere in the UK and the last was a Latvian national. Half of the fourteen passengers and two crew died \"instantaneously\" and the rest died very shortly after impact with the sea from , the inquiry found. \nNone survived long enough to drown, according to Sheriff Pyle. Nonetheless he noted \"there was a poignant moment when a witness was being taken through the graph in the AAIB report which set out the timeline of the accident that I, if not others present, understood for the first time the true horror of what took place.\"\nAudrey Wood said \"The length of wait for nearly five years has been intolerable for all the families and we, the families, feel let down by the system.\" Bond's statement this week says \"We would like to express again our deep sorrow at the 16 lives lost. Bond Offshore hopes [the inquiry] brings a degree of closure to the families, friends and dependents of those who died in the tragedy of 2009.\" The sheriff also noted the \"courage\" of victims' families, who attended the full hearing."}

TV commentators spoke of \"fascination throughout the field\" as big names retired and new names proved themselves.\nFormer champion Lewis Hamilton qualified on pole but problems were evident by the second lap when he received a team radio message telling him \"we need to retire... save the engine, save the engine!\" Another followed rapidly, however, telling him to \"just stay out, stay out, just keep on rolling\". Hamilton left the race on the fourth lap.\nReigning champion did not fare much better, having only qualified twelfth, with engine woes of his own. He too quit the race in the early stages, staying behind to watch the race and, according to commentator and retired Scottish F1 racer , learn what he could from the sidelines.\nVettel and Hamilton were not the only stars retiring early. Veteran racer was rammed from behind by Kobiashi's , sending both cars out and prompting deployment of for several laps while the debris was recovered. The crash was triggered by Kobiashi clipping , damaging the front of Kobiashi's car. Raikkonen stayed in the race and managed to finish eighth. The first ten cars over the finish line score points towards both the driver's and constructor's championships.\nCoulthard and fellow commentators believe Kobiashi, who took responsibility for the accident, may receive points on his racer's licence in a new system to deal with transgressions introduced this year. Kobiashi called the crash \"My mistake[... I] should have braked earlier, and I apologise to Felipe\". Massa said Kobiashi \"cannot do a start like that, every time\" he does so will lead to an accident.\nMore drama followed shortly after when clipped a wall on lap 10, breaking the rim of his back-right wheel. The rim was left on the track, followed shortly thereafter by the tyre off the wheel. The was deployed for several laps until the debris was recovered. Despite the setback Bottas climbed back up the standings and finished in sixth place.\nMany drivers, including cars at the front of the pack, took advantage of the safety car period to do pit stops. Some are now considering using less fuel than the maximum allowance in a move the never expected technologically possible when drafting the rules several years ago. \nIt was a day for d\u00e9butantes at , a street circuit where racing took place in close proximity to busy public roads. Newcomer Kevin Magnussen scored third place on his first F1 race, while fellow rookie Daniil Kvyat came in tenth and became the youngest-ever F1 points scorer. Kvyat takes the record from Vettel by several months while Magnussen becomes the first Dane on an F1 podium.\nNot every d\u00e9butante was so lucky; Caterham driver dropped out of his first race after being radioed \"Stop the car, stop the car, engine oil pressure\". Established racers Pastor Maldonado and Romain Grosjean, both drivers, also stopped with technical trouble. All three cars pulled up at the side of the track on different laps, each triggering yellow flags. Despite the retirements, fourteen cars finished which was more than some commentators were expecting. \nHamilton was upbeat about his retirement, saying \"It's tough for everyone but that's the way it is\" and adding \"We're not the only ones [to have difficulties]\". Vettel was more pessimistic, claiming this is \"going to be a long season\". Asked about the cause of his engine troubles, Hamilton said \"One of the cylinders, I think, was not firing\".\nThe race was unusual from start to finish, having been shortened by one lap after the first start was aborted by amber lights instead of just green. The end is more controversial; home driver Daniel Ricciardo scored his first-ever podium finish in second place but was later disqualified for an alleged breach of fuel regulations. Ricciardo had been the first Australian driver to stand on the podium in his home country since Formula 1 brought the event into the championship format used today.\nHis disqualification is not final, however. His team, Red Bull, have vowed to appeal. If the appeal fails all the drivers below him move up one position, meaning first-time entrant Magnussen will have come in second place and Kvyat will be ninth. That would see Sergio Perez score a point for Force India by moving into tenth. Perez's race was hampered early by a puncture picked up in the opening lap. \nRicciardo was reported to the stewards by technical delegate Jo Bauer who claimed his car \"exceeded consistently the maximum allowed fuel flow of 100kg/h\". 100kg is also the maximum fuel allowed on board cars, a new limit set for this season. The fuel flow rule is also new this year; F1 cars averaged about 170kg/h last year.\nRicciardo was disqualified after five hours of steward deliberations. Red Bull have hit back with a statement saying many teams have found the FIA's fuel flow meter to be faulty. They say they are \"confident the fuel supplied to the engine is in full compliance with the regulations.\" Today Andrew Westacott, chief executive of the Australian Grand Prix, said the appeal outcome may not be known for weeks.\nPrior to Ricciardo's disqualification, the remaining point-scorers were in fourth, in fifth, Nico Hulkenberg in seventh, and in ninth.\nRacers and fuel rules were not the only things fresh for this race. are on the back of their worst-ever season and have changed their livery to brighter, whiter cars. Another new innovation is the introduction of red lights on the rear of cars that blink when the vehicle is not using electricity, warning the car behind of possible deceleration. F1 cars also now sport hybrid turbo engines.\nRosberg, speaking after what is his first Australian victory, said it is \"Such a pleasure to have such a fast car.\" He came a full 24 seconds ahead of Ricciardo. It is also the hundredth victory by an F1 car powered by a engine.\n\"Whatever the outcome I'm really proud of what I did today\", Ricciardo said as he awaited the stewards' disqualification decision. \"There are more positives than negatives\"."}

The church he founded in 1955 became infamous for leading pickets at the funerals of US soldiers, as well as the funeral of Matthew Shepard, a young gay man killed in a attack in 1998.\nAt funeral pickets and other protests, Phelps and other members of his church held brightly coloured signs with messages including 'God Hates Fags', 'Thank God for ' and 'Thank God for Dead Soldiers'. The picketing of military funerals stems from the postion that God is punishing the United States for its acceptance of homosexuality. Military funerals have not been the only sites of Westboro's protests: the funeral of film critic and concerts by pop acts and \u2014 who the church described as \"crotch-grabbing little perverts\" \u2014 have also been targets of Westboro's protests. The Church has sued a great number of local authorities in the United States who attempted to block their demonstrations and the settlements from their cases helped fund their activities. In 2011, the Church won a case at the which upheld their right to demonstrate at funerals.\nOther countries were not so keen: Fred Phelps and his daughter Shirley Phelps-Roper were banned from entering the United Kingdom in order to take part in a planned protest against The Laramie Project, a play about the death of Matthew Shephard. The UK Border Agency stated the Phelpses were not welcome because of their actions \"inciting hatred against a number of communities\". The Church has seen a number of widely-reported defections including Megan Phelps-Roper, who used to run Westboro's social media operation before publicly leaving the congregation and publishing an apology on the Internet.\nBefore Phelps's death, he was from the Church \u2014 whose members are primarily drawn from his family. , Fred Phelps's son, posted on last week announcing his father's hospitalisation and illness: \"I\u2019ve learned that my father, Fred Phelps, Sr., pastor of the \u2018God Hates Fags\u2019 Westboro Baptist Church, was ex-communicated from the \u2018church\u2019 back in August of 2013. He is now on the edge of death at Midland Hospice house in Topeka, Kansas. I\u2019m not sure how I feel about this. Terribly ironic that his devotion to his god ends this way. Destroyed by the monster he made.\"\nNathan Phelps continued: \"I feel sad for all the hurt he\u2019s caused so many. I feel sad for those who will lose the grandfather and father they loved. And I\u2019m bitterly angry that my family is blocking the family members who left from seeing him, and saying their good-byes.\""}

Bury to grant an injunction against a new Arizona abortion law. On Wednesday Planned Parenthood and Arizona attorney Mike Tryon were in court to present their arguments.\nThe law passed in 2012 would take effect on April 1. According to Planned Parenthood, if the law takes effect, it will prevent some women from having an abortion. The states it is only regulating one form of abortion.\nAbortions are usually medical abortions, meaning medication is taken to induce abortion. The new law would only allow use of abortion medication just as approved by the (FDA) or specified by the product label. It would also require they administer the medication before seven weeks into the pregnancy. Previous cut off time was set at nine weeks. It would also require the medication be administered at the abortion facility. Planned Parenthood says requiring administration at the facility is a problem particularly for those outside of cities, as the medication is administered over several days.\nMedical abortions commonly combine two drugs, and . These two drugs are taken together. Doctors don't usually give them at the \"on-label\" dosage. For abortions misoprostol is given at a higher amount than the label says. Planned Parenthood says when it is given at the lower level the abortions may be unsuccessful and require surgery, putting the woman at additional risk. The other drug mifepristone has the opposite problem. The FDA has not updated their approval since 2000. The FDA approval is for a larger dose. Most doctors use the two together. They have found that when the two are combined they are just as effective as mifepristone alone, at the higher dose. Planned Parenthood says the combination of the two is the safest way to have an abortion. \nThe state says this law is part of their responsibility to protect public health.\nThe Judge is expected to rule before April 1, when the law would take effect."}

Most of his money has been given to charity, and he has sold off his businesses. \nHe announced his presidential candidature for this election before anyone else, about two years ago. Kiska said he chose to stand after witnessing impediments to his business and charitable work. He focused on his independence from other politicians and financial expertise. \nFico's party controls most of Slovakia's power institutions. A bitter election campaign saw Fico wage a against Kiska, who has filed criminal allegations against Fico. Incumbent President 's term ends June 15, with Kiska taking the reigns at a swearing-in the same day. \nDespite remaining out of recession, Slovakia suffers high unemployment which coupled with recent corruption allegations has shaken electorate faith in Fico and mainstream politics generally. Kiska promised to tackle corruption. His run-off election bid against Fico was widely supported by mainstream parties and defeated candidates from the previous round of elections. \nResults:"}

She told \"Wikinews\" her research facility will continue to work with its partners abroad and focus on genetic diversity. \n\"Realistically, the odds are against us. This is going to be a tough one to save. It's been a roller coaster experience and it\u2019s been a challenge,\" said Roth.\nIn the 1980s, Indonesia and the United States entered into a pact to save the animal. According to the plan, Indonesia would enclose captured rhinos in a secure wildlife habitat and provide United States zoos with additional captured rhinos, with the two working together to rebuild the population using the wildlife and captivity. The US program experienced a set back when four out of its seven rhinos died, while zoos were learning to feed them rather than . \nRoth is an expert on the propagation of the Sumatran rhino. Since the late 1990s, when the Cincinnati Zoo received the last three surviving captive rhinos in the United States, she has studied their mating and pregnancy. This led to the ability to detect pregnancy within sixteen days of conception by ultrasound. After five failed pregnancies, Roth tried hormone treatments of with success. In 2001, CREW and the Cincinnati Zoo celebrated the first rhino birth in captivity in 112 years, a male named Andalas. The previous Sumatran rhino birth in captivity occurred in 1889 in a zoo in Calcutta, India.\nRoth's work with Emi also produced Suci, a female born in 2004; and Harapan, a male born in 2007. Andalas was returned to Indonesia to sire Andatu, another success in the joint Indonesia-US project. Back in the US, the CREW facility would have to partner Suci with her brother Harapan once he reached sexual maturity between six to seven years age. Suci's death on Sunday ended that plan.\n\"We were hoping to produce another calf, for a number of different reasons. One is that the females do lose fertility over time if they don't get pregnant. So we thought even though were not doing a good genetic match, at least getting her pregnant would preserve her fertility. Although, we never got the opportunity to do that.\" Roth said.\nIndonesia will not be sending the US zoos any more Sumatran rhinos, Roth said, and for Indonesia it is a matter of national pride to rescue the Sumatran rhino."}

A poll published today by a number of newspapers shows a majority of the public unhappy with Miller's behaviour and saying she should be removed.\nThe issue stems initially from a report in the \"Daily Telegraph\" regarding Miller's expenses claims to help pay a mortgage on a house in south that Miller shares with her parents. The newspaper claimed that she had claimed 90,000 to pay the mortgage on the house. Miller's expenses have been the subject of investigation by a parliamentary commissioner and then by the Committee on Standards. The commissioner determined she should repay \u00a345,000 of this expense, but the Committee determined she ought to only repay \u00a35,800. Following the decision of the Committee, the \"Daily Telegraph\" reported Miller's special adviser Joanna Hindley had said in a telephone call with the newspaper, \"I should just flag up as well, while you're on it that when she doorstepped him, she got Maria's father, who\u2019s just had a [removed] and come out of [removed]. And Maria [has] obviously been having quite a lot of editors' meetings around at the moment. So I am just going to kind of flag up that connection for you to think about.\"\nThe \"Telegraph\" alleges that this was intended as a form of intimidation: that Hindley dropped in mention of press regulation and the Leveson Report as a way to attempt to get the newspaper to drop the story. A leader column in the \"Telegraph\" stated Hindley's remarks were \"an indictment of the influence that press regulation by statute could have over free speech\". , a Conservative MP (Member of Parliament), has defended Hindley's statements to the \"Telegraph\", as specifically referring to the \"doorstepping\" of Maria Miller's elderly parents, specifically her father who had been returning from hospital. Coffey said of the audio published by the \"Telegraph\": \"I heard an adviser to the culture secretary suggesting that it's inappropriate to be doorstepping elderly parents of somebody who has just come out of hospital.\"\n, a campaigner who has been involved in the release and publication of MPs' expenses and the scandal that followed, said the alleged doorstepping was \"a public interest piece of reporting\", noting that the journalist from the \"Telegraph\" had to visit the property to work out who was living there. Brooke said it was \"disingenuous to use this argument of privacy\".\n\"Telegraph\" editor also claimed that Craig Oliver, David Cameron's director of communications, also attempted to suppress the story: \"When you get the Prime Minister's spokesman making a similar phone call to you a couple of days later, you add all three calls up and you can only conclude that they are trying to harass you and stop you from publishing the story.\"\nOliver has denied the story. \"It is utterly false to suggest that I threatened Tony Gallagher over Leveson in any way. The conversation I had with him was about the inappropriate doorstepping of an old man\", he told the BBC.\nMiller has the backing of Prime Minister David Cameron: on Friday, Cameron told reporters to \"leave it there\" on questions of Miller's expenses. Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, suggested Miller could be targeted by a \"witch-hunt\" due to her role in press regulation following the Leveson inquiry, as well as her job in fronting the government's .\nDuncan Smith told the 's Andrew Marr Show: \"I am enormously fond of her. She has done a very good job in a very difficult set of circumstances with the Leveson inquiry that has stirred up a lot of media antipathy to her. And also the gay marriage stuff \u2014 there are a lot of Conservatives out there who, perhaps, were not necessarily in support of it all and so feel rather bitter about that. I have known her to be a reasonable and honest person.\"\nLabour politicians have responded to the affair with strong criticism of Miller, but no call yet to resign. , the leader of the House of Commons, said: \"The latest revelations and the release of a recording raise further serious questions for Maria Miller and David Cameron. They urgently need to make clear what they knew about these calls and what action they took about them.\""}

The suspects, two unnamed male Singaporeans, aged 22 and 23, were reportedly arrested at a shopping center in on Friday evening for possession of synthetic cannabis, also known as \"K2\". Authorities recovered 71.7\u00a0 of the drug from the suspects. \nUnder suspicion from the CNB that the 22-year-old suspect was engaged in trafficking of the illegal substance, a further search of his home yielded an additional 22.3 g of synthetic cannabis, raising the total amount of the drug confiscated following the arrests to 94\u00a0g.\nSynthetic cannabis, listed as an NPS, and known as a \"legal high\", is one of a group of designer drugs created to stimulate the effects of controlled drugs including cocaine, Ecstasy, , and heroin. The CNB has linked NPS abuse to symptoms including severe intoxication, hallucinations, paranoia, seizures, cadiovascular problems, renal failure, and death.\nTypically having chemical structure very similar but slightly different from controlled drugs, these substances have been illegalized, and their possession, consumption, trafficking, and manufacturing now carry penalties comparable to that of controlled drugs. Last year, under the Fifth Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act, designed to study NPSs before their illegalization, they could be confiscated by authorities, but no further penalty would be levied.\nThe changes to NPS status follow increases over the past year in NPS trafficking and consumption, according to the CNB. Commenting on the move, a spokesperson for the CNB revealed the organization has reported at least thirty NPS seizures in the period from last May through this February. \"Thus far,\" the spokesperson noted, \"synthetic and synthetic are the two more commonly detected NPS\".\nTermed an \"alarming new drug problem\" by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, its World Drug Report 2013 indicated an increase to 348 NPSs in 2013, up from 251 in 2012. Capitalizing on their legality \u2014 which no longer holds in Singapore \u2014 NPSs have been known as \"legal highs\", \"research chemicals\", \"plant food\", and \"bath salts\".\nCommenting on the illegalization of NPSs, Ng Ser Song, the director of the CNB, had this to say. \u201cThe drug situation is challenging and the number of repeat drug abusers and young drug abusers remains a concern. With the abuse and trafficking of NPS on the rise, listing these new psychoactive substances as Class A controlled drugs signals our unequivocal stance that these substances are illegal and no different from other controlled drugs.\u201d \nUnder the recently enacted First Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act, if found guilty of drug trafficking, the 22-year-old suspect may be penalized with a minimum of five years in prison and five strokes of the cane. The act also allows the possession or consumption of New Psychoactive Substances to be punished with a maximum of 10 years imprisonment and/or a 20,000 fine."}

Reports variously state the final price of the whale, prior to the removal of the listing from the auction site on Monday at about 2:30pm, was C$2,025 or C$2,075. Listed in eBay's \"really weird\" category, the carcass was considered by eBay to be an example of \"items made from marine mammals regardless of when the product was made\", which are prohibited as per site rules.\nFollowing a council meeting on Sunday in the town of 950 residents, Cape St. George's mayor, Peter Fenwick, put the whale up on the auction site in a bid to have it removed from the town's premises, citing a lack of cooperation from provincial and federal government officials on the matter. \"It's your problem, you solve it\", Fenwick recounted to \" (TGaM) as the response he received from them. Apart from eBay, was also suggested as another avenue by which to sell the carcass.\nFenwick told \", several years prior another sperm whale measuring 15 ft was beached in the area, but disappeared without incident, an act Fenwick attributed to be the work of . \"This time\", he remarked, \"the authorities have told us that it's our whale, it's our responsibility to get rid of it.\"\nOn putting the carcass for sale, Fenwick remarked, \"We knew we had to do something with it and this seemed to be the least expensive way of disposing of it.\" In a news release, Fenwick highlighted a possible use for the carcass, particularly its bones. \"The 40 foot sperm whale will make a spectacular exhibit once the fat and muscle is removed, and the town is asking museums and other organizations that could use a whale skeleton to contact the town for further details.\" \nOn retaining the whale himself, Fenwick stated, \"As a town we would dearly love to keep the whale and put it on exhibit in the town but the cost of such a venture would be hard to justify.\" Fenwick told TGaM the whale was \"in half decent shape\". \"This one looks like it died very recently and hasn\u2019t decomposed much\", which Fenwick suggested elsewhere was due to the whale's present location, partially submerged in near-freezing water. However, Fenwick noted its close proximity to a residential area, saying homeowners who lived there were \"very interested in seeing the whale gone.\"\neBay was not the only organization who barred the sale from taking place. \"We also got threatened by the federal department of the environment, and told to pull the ad off or they would prosecute us\", said Fenwick on the opposition he said he received from , which viewed the sale as contravening a federal act designed to protect endangered species. \"I received a call from the federal department of the environment saying that you're not allowed to sell any parts of sperm whales, even if they\u2019re dead.\" he added. \"So I said, 'Oh that's very good, I\u2019m glad to hear that, now can you send somebody over here to get rid of it for us?'\" Fenwick's request was met with a negative response from Environment Canada.\n\"They've got to sort it out somehow. The uncertainty means it just sort of sits there and rots.\" Once decomposition sets in, Fenwick remarked the carcass would become a \"real nuisance\". \"I don't know if you've ever seen a whale that\u2019s been rotting on the beach for a couple of months \u2014 actually sometimes you can\u2019t see it for the clouds of flies around it \u2014 but you can smell it for about a mile\", he added.\nOn finding alternate means to dispose of the carcass, Wayne Ledwell, a member of Newfoundland's Whale Release and Strandings, suggested the whale be towed out to a remote area. \"They need to do that right away, when they come in and they\u2019re fresh,\" said Ledwell. \"No one wants to go touch them ... everything becomes gooey and slippery and you can't stand up on the whale and it gets on your boots and you can\u2019t get the smell off and then you go home and the dog rolls in it and you get it in your kitchen and you curse the whales, and you curse the government and ... it becomes a mess.\" Fenwick said they'd considered the idea, enlisting a local fisherman who, however, judged his engine too small for the job. \nPreviously, carcasses washed ashore in the towns of and , located about 150 further north, and were taken by for preservation of the skeletons. Fenwick suggested the sperm whale carcass in his town might also meet a similar fate, as the sperm whale's status as the largest toothed whale might prove to be a drawing attraction for such a facility.\nRegarding what he plans to do next with the carcass, Fenwick said \"If we're not allowed to sell it, we're willing to drop our 99 cent price down to a zero.\" He said he hoped some eBay bidder stays interested in the whale. \"We'll be glad to talk to them about giving them the whale. We\u2019re hoping that's not illegal.\" He also said he hoped the publicity from the town's predicament, which garnered national attention, and its unusual means of finding a solution, would draw in someone interested in taking the whale off his hands at their own expense. \nShould the whale fall under new ownership, Fenwick advised it be moved away from the town to a beach devoid of people, and the blubber left as food for seagulls, insects, and other predators. He estimated \"It'll probably take a year or so to get down to the skeleton.\" As monetary gain was reportedly not what the town cared about, Fenwick was willing to offer the carcass for free, though one report noted money raised from the listing could have gone towards the building of a skate park.\nThe listing on eBay, as put up by Fenwick, read:"}

Police vans were moved to block the road; although, traffic to the venue was still being permitted for a wedding party with the misfortune to pick the same date as Farage's only visit to Scotland during the current European Parliament election campaign.\nSeveral speakers addressed the crowd protesting against UKIP being in Scotland, with the actual number of UKIP attendees inside, to hear Farage speak, estimated at around 50. One speaker, a schoolteacher, challenged the mainstream media's acceptance of UKIP's assertion the party is not racist, stating her primary school pupils were more-capable of identifying racism and would be pointing its presence out within UKIP were they present.\nAlthough loud, the protest passed peacefully. Chants directed at UKIP included \"Whose streets? Our streets! Whose city? Our city!\", \"Say it loud, say it clear: Refugees are welcome here!\" Other taunts called UKIP \"scum\", urged people to \"smash the \" (\"Scottish Defence League\"), and clearly labelled UKIP and its supporters as racist."}
