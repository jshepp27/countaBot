A first step is learning how to follow then learning how to create then learning how to lead. Altough its not the tech aspect that I am interested nor the money its the people that I can influence along the way to become better versions of themselves and to achieve the best as a team.I am passionate about people and about inspiring them and bringing the best out of them and me.With that said I am flunking my current jobs because of that since I view them as not something as fulfilling more repetitive grunt work that brings in money.The conflict here inside my head is that I believe playing for the late game sticking to my direction whatever it may be as long as it is something I want to do in life in order to be fulfilled and in my best possible environment and this view opposes to the idea that you have to be a succesful and mature person and do what pays well and what you are supposed to do and fight for the day for the month to pay your bills and put food on the table.I view that looking ahead is more important than sticking to what is easy and pays well especially if you do not have affinity for it.In the business world what I see that is a main focus of the leaders is money as a metric when I know that money is just a means and other aspects and values of my life is way more important than that. First update My view has changed in the way that when living in poverty the priority and importance shifts towards money when you dont have the basic needs set. I agree that money is more important in that case because you simply cannot have the time energy and strength to focus your entire time on chasing your dream since you are starving and on the streets.Updated statement Following your passion and finding the right job is more important than making a lot of money once you have your basic needs in checkSecond many update From this thread what I understood thanks to the users and Mike Rowe is that there are two things First you have to make a living and bring the passion with you.'"

I cannot imagine that any animal would give its consent to dying just in order to satisfy a persons appetite. Furthermore I dont see a moral difference between acts of bestiality and some methods of animal husbandry.Consider this howto on collecting bull semen for the purpose of analysis How can anybody claim that a bull would consent to the insertion of an electric probe into its anus and how is that morally different from a zoophile inserting their penis into a bulls anus?I dont see a justification for either behavior on natural grounds because while I think that both the consumption of meat and the desire to have sex with animals can come about naturally that is to say not artificially there are plenty of things which occur naturally rape infanticide kidnapping that we all agree are immoral.After giving out three deltas I think my view on the question as I posed it has been changed.',\n  'label': []},\n 't3_2jalt8': {'argument': 'By information I mean things like software music movies photographs or anything that can be replicated infinitely.Dont get me wrong I do believe in laws that encourage creativity.

This is proven in many real world implementations to reduce the abortion rate by upwards of in the first year and more as time passes.But the forced birthers arent supporting programs like that. In fact in Colorado where such a program existed funded for the first few years by private funds which ran out the forced birth faction actively campaigned AGAINST continuing the program with tax dollars.When I ask forced birth advocates about this they almost inevitably reply either that they dont believe their tax dollars should subsidize someone elses sex life or that they believe it is immoral to have sex outside marriage and that its certainly immoral for teenagers to have sex.The problem here and the reason why this leads me to think they dont really believe abortion is murder is that this means theyre prioritizing their own taxeconomic beliefs above saving babies or that theyre prioritizing their discomfort with people having sex in ways they dont like above saving babies.It isnt just that they have to prioritize its that they have prioritized. Perhaps not in a deliberate step by step conscious process but they have at least subconsciously prioritized their own tax or moral beliefs above killing babies.Im forced to conclude that either theyre monsters who but a monster would argue that their tax policy is worth murdering babies or that theyre not being honest about their belief that abortion is murder.If as they argue abortion is murder and that therefore it is worth sacrificing womens bodily autonomy to prevent it then surely it follows that if abortion is murder its worth them sacrificing a few tax dollars or a bit of squik on their part.',\n  'label': []},\n 't3_2e6v25': {'argument': 'Reference Article I dont buy into the idea that the president should never play golf or relax in any way.

However I believe these are offset and outnumbered by the tyranny and atrocities committed under nondemocratic governments.When I say this I mean that I believe comparing modern and past democracies to modern and past dictatorships and monarchies throughout history will yield the conclusion that the quality of life in a democracy is substantially better for most people and that as more people are given franchise the better and better it gets.

These increases in food production were made possible by a string of innovations and increases in productivity through technological and methodological advances in farming like crop rotation better plowing tools use of animal labour use of manure as fertilizer breeding of crops and livestock chemically produced fertilizers and pesticides and as of late genetic modification of crops.Today is the first time in recorded history that we deliberately use farming methods that decrease output under the moniker of organic food production. I believe that the desire for organic food production is a symptom of rich and saturated societies and is what we here know as a first world problem. This desire has the potential to compromise the global food output if it becomes more widespread and increase the number of people living in hunger and dying from starvation.I dont contest that chemically produced fertilizers and pesticides and GMO crops must be used carefully and in measured amounts to get the riskbenefit balance right and yes there are risks hazards and dangers associated with them. I dont contest either that early pesticides were rather poisonous and at times did more harm than good especially when used naively.However science and engineering progress all the time pesticides become better more specific fertilizers become better to handle cheaper and less energyintensive to produce GMO crops continue what breeding programs have done in the past that is improve a plant species for more and potentially healthier output with equal production cost.And thus I believe that organic food production is a dangerous fad and that to increase food output and eradicate hunger and malnutriton we must use and improve industrial farming methods using and improving all means available to us intelligently and wisely and without the prejudice of labelling something that came out of a chemical plant as bad while labelling something that came out of a cows arse as somehow magically good and instead have a sane costbenefit analysis that takes into account all that is availabe to us.Quite simply we must not throw away much of the food production techniques what served us well the last couple of hundred years because that could kill a large portion of humans alive today.Change my view.',\n  'label': 'Organic food'},\n {'id': 't3_4oh27m',\n  'argument': '.

For each animal or plant that violates the statute can carry a prison sentence of up to years and up to a fine.I know about this only because I got interested in overcriminalization and Im still not sure if there is some foreign law where housecats are illegal.There are other things like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act EDIT which is not strict liability but is overly broad in its scope compared to what it was originally intended to do and extremely harsh in its penalties which everyone on Reddit very well may be violating since we dont have written consent to access the server this is generally not enforced but see below and many other felonies that we commit daily.This is a problem because of the way the system works in practice if a DA really wants to smear someone they can just investigate records and tack on charge after charge after charge racking up dozens of regulatory offenses that pack some thousandyears worth of criminal sentencing theyll then offer a ridiculously low plea deal and so more and more often people are going to jail without ever seeing a courtroom because of the intimidation tactics used by prosecutors.I feel as though there needs to be some easier system of determining that the punishments a law prescribes are too severe for the crime it describes but I cant devise such a system on my own.',\n  'label': 'laws'},\n {'id': 't3_46bq7c',\n  'argument': 'My boyfriend and I got into a debate about whether aliens are flying around our galaxy and solar system and entering our planet.I argued that if there were aliens flying around in outer space even if theyre not entering Earth we would have heard about them from scientists.
