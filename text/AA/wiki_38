It was found using data from an array of automated telescopes called the (WASP). The study was published in the journal \".\nThe star belongs to the galaxy and is approximately 600 away from Earth. Its mean radius is about 80 percent the size of the largest planet in the , Jupiter, but despite its small size it is very dense. Its mass is almost 85\u00b14 times the , the study said. The star's surface gravitational pull is about eleven times stronger than the 's \u2014 300 times the strength by which the Earth attracts matter. It is part of a , meaning it moves around the galaxy with another star, both orbiting around the same central point. However, it stays so close to its companion star, that it takes about 7.8 days to orbit around the pair's shared centre. The distance between the two stars is less than between and the Sun, and about eight percent of an , in stark contrast to the 100\u20131000 astronomical units that typically separates two stars in such a system.\nIt was discovered by the method called \". This method is used to discover planets or satellites, and the astronomers initially thought it was merely an exoplanet. During a planet's revolution, when it crosses its parent star, there is a dip in the brightness of the light coming from the parent star. The companion of this dwarf is the size of the Sun, and it is brighter than the dwarf, making the discovery more difficult. \"Indeed, until we measured the mass it looked just like a transiting planet\", Amaury Triaud, co-author of the paper, told \"\". With a brightness 2000 to 3000 times fainter than the Sun, it was the mass that indicated it was actually a dim star.\nAccording to lead author of the study, Alexander von Boetticher, their \"discovery reveals how small stars can be.\" He added, \"Had this star formed with only a slightly lower mass, the of in its core could not be sustained, and the star would instead have transformed into a \". A brown dwarf converts hydrogen to , a hydrogen , rather than helium, which is the usual result of such a process from most stars including the Sun.\nThe tiny star's temperature is lesser than most known gas giant exoplanets. \"That star likely represents the smallest natural fusion reactor that we know of[...] We're trying to replicate fusion on Earth in labs, but that's basically as small as it gets in nature\", Triaud told CBC News. The size of the star makes it difficult to study, but the brightness of its companion star also makes it more challenging. \"It's like trying to look at a candle beside a lighthouse,\" Triaud said."}

Times of high activity are also the most likely time for , which often emanate from sunspot regions. On rare occasions these eruptions of plasma may hit the Earth's magnetic field, setting it oscillating. It then releases previously trapped particles as the . Occasionally, the effects are so intense that these charged particles and magnetic effects can ding the performance of satellites and power grids. The poles flip at the time of high activity, and the intensity of the magnetic field peaks when the Sun is least active. A hypothetical heat-proof compass on the surface of the Sun would point toward one pole during one eleven-year period but toward the other during the next.\nTo predict and explain this activity, Strugarek and colleagues developed a model of the , high-energy matter, inside the sun and examined how its flow and change could create magnetic fields. To build this model, they incorporated data from 27 different stars. .\nThey found the Sun operated on the same basic principles as other stars: The activity of all stars in the system was found to be driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else. The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's , which is related to plasma flow. The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star with respect to magnetic reversals."}

Teams from different countries were arranged in groups of three, and groups faced off in pairs. The group whose three robots collectively earned the most points won that match. According to the Afghan team's coach, Alireza Mehraban, in their first matchup, the Afghan team's robot, named \"Better Idea of Afghan Girls,\" scored one or two points for the three-nation alliance with the Gabonese and Estonian teams.

Afghanistan is not one of the nations covered by President Trump's travel ban, but teams from Sudan, Iran, Libya, and Yemen, which are covered, are among the 163 teams in the competition. There were also two Syrian teams scheduled to compete, one national and one made up of refugees. Syria and all refugees are covered by the ban.

The Afghan team's supplies were delayed, leaving them only two weeks left to assemble their robot and only one day to test it before packing it up to mail to the competition site.\nThe competition ended on Tuesday.

The proposed law was met with protesters across Poland asking Duda to veto the bill and objections from officials of the European Union, who described the measure as anti-democratic. Duda also planned to veto another law that would have placed the council that proposes candidates for judgeship under the power of government officials.\n\"I have decided to send back to parliament \u2014 in which case to veto \u2014 the law on the supreme court, as well as the law on the National Council of the Judiciary.\" These laws \"would not strengthen the sense of justice in society,\" Duda told the public. He said he made this decision after extensive consultation with experts in a variety of areas, including legal experts, and particularly anti-communist activist .\nSpecifically, the law would require every one of Poland's more than 80 Supreme Court justices resign and would empower the justice minister of the governing party to choose which justices will return to the bench and which must be replaced, and with whom.

White had suffered from kidney cancer for several years.\nWhite's son, Andrew paid tribute to his father and said, \"He [Mark White] cared about Texas deeply [...] He realized that this wasn't about getting re-elected. This wasn't about being popular. This was about making Texas a better place.\" Former Texan Lieutenant Governor called White \"one of Texas' greatest governors\".\nThe current Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott also paid tribute to White saying, \"Mark White cared deeply about Texas [...] and he devoted his life to making our state even better, particularly when it came to educating our children.\"\nBorn in 1940, White served as Texas' secretary of state and attorney general before he became the governor. He defeated then-incumbent Republican, to become Governor in 1983 despite Clements spending thirteen million dollars on his campaign. Four years later, Clements defeated White to become Texas' governor.\nWhite brought few educational reforms including the \"No-Pass, No-Play\" policy. Per the policy, students had to maintain a minimum threshold of grades to participate in school sports and extra-curricular activities. The decision was unpopular among many and even blocked by a state-district judge. The state Supreme Court eventually approved the policy. \nDefending the \"No-Pass, No-Play policy\" in 1987, White told the state lawmakers, \"Let's be real: Anyone who can study a playbook can study a textbook. Americans didn't get to the moon on a quarterback sneak.\"\nAfter losing in his re-election attempt in 1987, White returned to private law practice and also became the owner of a security company. In 1990, he ran for the office again, but lost to in the Democratic primary who later became the Governor."}

The court disagreed with Briggs' claim, writing that \"Proposition 66 is more focused on a single subject\" than other measures upheld by the court. \nThe weakened portioned of the measure would have set a deadline of five years for the appeals process.

A federal court imposed a moratorium on the use of California's lethal injection method in 2006 after a challenge to the methods used.

They argue that Trump's decision to resume deportation was based on racism and therefore illegal and that deporting DACA beneficiaries would harm the economies of their respective states.\nThe suit reads, in part: \"Ending DACA, whose participants are mostly of Mexican origin, is a culmination of President Trump's oft-stated commitments \u2014 whether personally held, stated to appease some portion of his constituency, or some combination thereof \u2014 to punish and disparage people with Mexican roots.\" The greatest number of DACA beneficiaries are from Mexico, and the next most common countries of birth are El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.\nAccording to New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman, his state is home to 42,000 DACA participants, also called dreamers, after the DREAM Act, a proposed law that would have made something similar to the DACA program a law rather than an executive policy. \"Dreamers play by the rules. Dreamers work hard. Dreamers pay taxes. For most of them, America is the only home they've ever known. And they deserve to stay here,\" he said. According to the lawsuit, 50 DACA participants are students at , one the most prestigious schools in the U.S.\nAt the U.S. government's last count, the DACA program covered 787,580 people. It allowed undocumented immigrants who had come to the U.S. under the age of 16 and were no older than 30 in 2012 to apply for temporary federal permits for legal residency, which expire after two years. These in turn allow them to file for work permits and drivers' licenses. It made it much easier for them to attend four-year colleges and for the government to collect income tax. The Trump administration describes this as a phasing out rather than an immediate cancellation. Some DACA participants will be allowed to renew their permits, but only until October and only for participants whose existing permits would expire by next March.\nPresident Trump invited Congress to take action on the dream issue: \"We will resolve the DACA issue with heart and compassion \u2014 but through the lawful Democratic process \u2014 while at the same time ensuring that any immigration reform we adopt provides enduring benefits for the American citizens we were elected to serve,\" President Trump told the press on Tuesday. \"We must also have heart and compassion for unemployed, struggling, and forgotten Americans.\" Under the new Trump policy, if Congress does not pass a law establishing a program for DACA participants, 300,000 would lose legal status next year.\nWashington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson, accompanied by now-adult DACA recipients who work for the state legislature, announced to the press, \"It's outrageous, it's not right[...] As attorney general for the state of Washington, I have a hammer, it's the law.\" Ferguson also sued Donald Trump earlier this year over a travel ban prohibiting people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.\nDACA was not a law but rather an executive policy established by Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama. The U.S. Constitution gives the legislative branch of the government, Congress, the duty of establishing laws but the executive branch, headed by the President, the duty of enforcing them. The DACA program was examined by lawyers from the U.S. Department of Justice in 2014, and they determined then-President Barack Obama did have the authority to decline to enforce existing immigration laws in this way.\nThe suit was filed by attorneys general from North Carolina, Hawaii, Washington, New York, Illinois, Iowa, Oregon, New Mexico, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Vermont, and Rhode Island and the country's capital, Washington D.C., all of whom are Democrats. The attorney general of California, home to one out of four DACA participants, stated intent through a spokesperson to file a separate lawsuit."}

The island commonwealth had been given a temporary exemption from this law to allow foreign ships to aid the delivery of relief supplies after , which struck Puerto Rico last month. Puerto Ricans and lawmakers had asked for an extension of the waiver in light of the island's current difficulties.\n\"We believe that extending the waiver is unnecessary to support the humanitarian relief efforts on the island[...] There is an ample supply of Jones Act-qualified vessels to ensure that cargo is able to reach Puerto Rico,\" reads a statement from Homeland Security Press Secretary David Lapan.\nThe Jones Act of 1920 requires that all ships carrying cargo directly from one U.S. port to another must be built, operated and owned by U.S. personnel. Puerto Rico, a U.S. commonwealth, falls under its jurisdiction. President Donald Trump issued a temporary waiver of this requirement for Puerto Rico on September 28 to help the relief effort. However, there were also concerns about supplies sitting idle in ports for lack of organized distribution and truck drivers to take them where they were needed. Some foreign ships may take until October 18 to complete deliveries.\nRepublicans Marco Rubio and John McCain were among those in the U.S. Congress who had urged President Trump to issue the waiver, though McCain supported making the exemption permanent: \"Now that the temporary Jones Act waiver for Puerto Rico has expired, it is more important than ever for Congress to pass my bill to permanently exempt Puerto Rico from this archaic and burdensome law,\" he told the \"Huffington Post\". \"Until we provide Puerto Rico with long-term relief, the Jones Act will continue to hinder much-needed efforts to help the people of Puerto Rico recover and rebuild from Hurricane Maria.\"\nIn September, Puerto Rico was nicked by the same that left Florida in disarray but then pummeled head-on by Hurricane Maria. The crisis displaced thousands of people and led to extraordinary rainfall and flash flood scares after a large crack appeared in the Guajataca Dam. According to Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, 85% of residents remain without electricity, and many also still lack access to running water.\nPuerto Rico was colonized by Spain and came under U.S. control in the in 1898, along with Guam and the Philippines. Every person born in Puerto Rico is a United States citizen by birth. Puerto Rican residents do not participate in national elections, hold no seats in the , and have a non-voting representative in the U.S. congress. Mostly, they are exempt from but not other federal taxes.\nEvery few years, the Puerto Ricans hold a referendum to determine whether they wish to remain a commonwealth, seek U.S. statehood, or seek independence in some form. In June, 97% of voters selected the second option, though turnout was low, and Congress is not legally required to obey their wishes."}

Mohd Shah, an employee of the Malaysian government, testified that , by international treaty a weapon of mass destruction, caused Kim's death, and Judge Azmi Ariffin officially admitted tissue and fluid samples as evidence. Both Aisyah and Huong are subject to the death penalty if convicted of killing Kim.\nThe samples were sealed in plastic when presented at court, but the judge and lawyers for both the prosecution and defense nonetheless wore protective gloves and masks to examine them. Both the North Korean government and Aisyah's lawyer have said the victim may have died of a heart attack or some cause other than VX nerve agent.\nMohd Shah based his conclusion on VX nerve agent in Kim's system and on the timing of Kim's death: he expired on the way to a hospital, less than two hours after encountering Aisyah and Huong. He also testified Kim Jong Nam had six different medications in his system, one a common Viagra heart-condition treatment, but no indications of a heart attack when he examined Kim's body. He also said neither this nor the other medicines Kim was taking would have killed him quickly.\nAisyah's lawyer, Gooi Soon Seng, argued the autopsy reports indicate only that Kim was killed by chemical poisoning, not necessarily by VX nerve agent, and Mohd Shah admitted under he does not have much experience with VX and other nerve agents.\nSiti Aisyah, 25, and Doan Thi Huong, age given as 28 or 29, pled not guilty of murdering Kim Jong Nam on Monday, though they do not contest they met him. Both were represented by lawyers hired by their home countries' respective governments. Both women are on video approaching Kim in Kuala Lumpur International Airport where one of them sprayed him with liquid, but they both claimed they had been hired to spray travelers with a harmless substance as part of a prank TV show. Aisyah's lawyer, Gooi Soon Seng, told the press his client had already performed the prank several times, always with oil or pepper. According to the police, the two men who hired Huong and Aisyah were Hong Song Hac and Ri Ji U, North Koreans who avoided questioning by, respectively, fleeing Malaysia and remaining within the North Korean embassy.\nHuong's lawyer, Hisyam Teh Poh Teik, said after a prosecution phase of probably about two months, at the Judge's discretion the defense would proceed. Proceedings earlier this week included testimony from an airport employee, a police officer who spoke to the dying Kim, and pathologists who examined samples from Kim, Huong and Aisyah. Dr. Norashikin Othman of Hospital Kuala Lumpur testified Kim Jong Nam's blood, liver and other tissues appeared to have been depleted of cholinesterase, an enzyme we need to move. \"The low cholinesterase level in Kim Chol could be caused by exposure to poisons such as insecticide or nerve agents,\" he said, and that Huong and Aisyah both had normal levels of cholinesterase. He said the two women could have protected themselves by washing their hands, which both women did that day, or by taking antidote.\nGooi Soon Seng told the press the prosecution had not disclosed this information to the defense before Norashikin's testimony: \"This piece of evidence was never served to us\".\nSouth Korean has maintained this was part of a plan on the part of Kim Jong Un or his government to assassinate Kim Jong Nam, who had once been his father Kim Jong Il's heir apparent. They had a falling out in 2001 and Kim Jong Nam had been living quietly with his family in .\nThe events surrounding Kim's death have included diplomatic troubles between the formerly friendly North Korea and Malaysia, a hostage exchange, ambassador expulsions, and a break-in at the mortuary that housed Kim's remains.\nEarlier statements from Malaysia's health ministry asserted Kim died within twenty minutes of his encounter at the airport, but testimony given this week differed from this."}

The study was performed in two national parks in California, United States.\nFor the past twenty-five years, spotted owl habitat preservation has focused on keeping 70% or more of the total ground area covered by natural tree canopy, a tree density that leaves forests prone to wildfires and trees more likely to die during droughts. Both wildfires and droughts have become more frequent in the years since the program began. \nHowever, the previous studies upon which the 70% figure was based only measured overall canopy coverage. In this work, researchers used aerial (Light Detection And Ranging) imaging technology to scan areas within and in California. The regions were analyzed by distribution of foliage, tree height, and the sizes of the spaces between trees and stands. These data were then cross-referenced with decades of field studies showing the locations of hundreds of owl nests. They found that spotted owls clustered in areas with very tall trees and stands almost exclusively, over 150 feet (48 m), avoiding areas that only had moderate or low canopy, regardless of how dense or wide.\n\"This could fundamentally resolve the management problem because it would allow for reducing small tree density, through fire and thinning,\" said lead author Malcolm North, of UC Davis and the USDA Pacific Southwest Research Station. \"We've been losing the large trees, particularly in these extreme wildfire and high drought-mortality events. This is a way to protect more large tree habitat, which is what the owls want, in a way that makes the forest more resilient to these increasing stressors that are becoming more intense with climate change.\"\nThe spotted owl gained national prominence in the United States during the 1990s, when environmentalists' efforts to preserve its habitat resulted in federal measures forbidding logging on large swaths of land, as well as federal limits on the sales of harvested wood. There was a 1995 U.S. Supreme Court case which was preceded by lawsuits on the part of timber companies and by years of large protests by timber workers and their communities who feared job losses. For a time, it seemed that the spotted owl was also threatened by competition from the faster-breeding , which had moved west into its territory.\nThis is not the only major study of spotted owls to reach the public eye this week. On Thursday, the released the California Spotted Owl Conservation Objectives Report, which analyzes the past several decades of research on the California spotted owl and provides recommendations for ecologically and economically viable conservation."}

The plaintiffs claimed that this caused them mental and emotional problems, in addition to the loss of their ancestral culture. Carolyn Bennett, Canada's Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister, announced the agreement.\n\"I have great hope that because we've reached this plateau, this will never, ever happen in Canada again,\" Marcia Brown Martel, now Chief of the Beaverhouse First Nation, said of the decision. Martel was removed from her home as many as ten times before 1972. She and her sister were among the original plaintiffs. From the 1960s to 1980s, some of the children were sent out of the country to the United States, Europe or New Zealand. Some of the plaintiffs say they were abused by their foster families and others do not. A separate settlement has been offered to the 150,000 children who were instead sent to institutions, such as boarding schools. \n\"There is also no dispute about the fact that great harm was done,\" wrote Ontario Supreme Court Justice Edward P. Belobaba in a preliminary decision in February. \"The 'scooped' children lost contact with their families. They lost their aboriginal language, culture and identity. Neither the children nor their foster or adoptive parents were given information about the children's aboriginal heritage or about the various educational and other benefits that they were entitled to receive. The removed children vanished 'with scarcely a trace.'\u2009\" He did concede that the founders of the program meant well, but major sources agree it was subject to considerable culture clash, with social workers removing children from situations that were later found not to be abusive or neglectful.\nAccording to a lawyer for some of the plaintiffs, Jeffrey Wilson, this is the first time anyone has argued that the loss of a cultural identity in a lawsuit in a country: \"No First Nations case yet to this day has asked the question as to whether or not the loss of identity is an actionable wrong. Aboriginal title to property has been litigated, aboriginal title to identity has not,\" he told the \"The Guardian\".\nThe First Nations people make up approximately four percent of Canada's population, at about 1.4 million people, and they suffer disproportionately from poverty, violence, addiction and crime.\nCanada is not the only country where native children were taken away from their families. From 1910 to 1970, the Australian government collected children, who came to be called the , and relocated them to schools and other institutions far from their communities. In 1978, the United States passed the to curtail similar actions toward children. \nManitoba was the first of Canada's provinces to apologize for the scoop program, in 2015. The federal government has also announced plans to make a public apology."}

Co-author Ropars said, \"Our observations lead us to believe that we indeed found a potential cause of dyslexia\".\nIn dyslexic individuals, the pattern of photoreceptors in the right eye is similar to that on the left and produces a \"mirror image\", while in non-dyslexic individuals, there are two different patterns in the two eyes, researchers found in their study. Individuals with dyslexia have difficulty reading, especially distinguishing between letters that are mirror images of each other, like the characters 'b' and 'd' or 'p' and 'q'.\nIn the back of the eye, there is a site called the fovea which contains , of three kinds responding either to red, green, or blue light. In one patch within the fovea, there are cone cells for red and green but none for blue. In the dominant eye, with greater connectivity to the brain, this spot was found to be round while in the other eye, it was asymmetrical. This, researchers speculate, allows the brain to choose just one of the two images to work with. The researchers observed the dyslexic individuals have round spots in both eyes, which produces mirror images, and the brain can not decide which one to consider.\n\"For dyslexic students their two eyes are equivalent and their brain has to successively rely on the two slightly different versions of a given visual scene,\" the researchers said. According to Ropars, this may also serve as a means of diagnosing dyslexia.\nUsing an LED lamp, researchers observed images from the two eyes do not reach the hemispheres of the brain at the same time, with there being a delay of about ten thousandths of a second. The researchers were able to use a flashing LED light, which was flashed at high frequency that it became invisible to the observer's eye to allow the study participants to process only one image by \"cancelling\" one of the two produced in each eye.\nResearch participants called this LED light the \"magic lamp.\" Ropars said more testing is to be done to confirm this technique's efficacy in treating dyslexia."}

NGTS-1b is a , similar to Jupiter and of comparable volume and mass, but its parent star is about half the diameter and mass of the Sun, making this the most massive planet orbiting an M-dwarf ever discovered.\nNGTS-1b, about 600 from the Earth, is so extremely close to its star that a revolution around its star takes only about 2.6 Earth days \u2014 2.647298 \u00b1 0.000020 \u2014 and its surface temperature is about 800 . The planet was discovered by observing periodic fluctuations in the star's apparent brightness as NGTS-1b passed in front of it. NGTS-1b's mass is less than Jupiter, about 0.812 (mass of Jupiter), but it has greater volume, with radius about 1.33 (radius of Jupiter). Its density was reported to be 0.42 \u00a0-3 (with error: +0.59 to -0.28), meaning Jupiter, whose density is 1.326 g\u00a0cm-3, is likely around thrice as dense as the exoplanet.\n\"The discovery of NGTS-1b was a complete surprise to us,\" said lead author Doctor Daniel Bayliss of the , in . \"[S]uch massive planets were not thought to exist around such small stars. This is the first exoplanet we have found with our new NGTS facility and we are already challenging the received wisdom of how planets form.\"\nThe existing understanding of planetary formation, the team explained, says small stars can produce rocky planets but cannot pull in enough mass for larger, gaseous ones like NGTS-1b. Based on the observations, NGTS-1's radius is 0.573\u00b10.077 (solar radius) and using that value, astronomers calculated its weight to be about 0.598 (solar mass). The star's density is almost ten times of the gas giant, 4.4 (with error: +2.4 to -1.4) g\u00a0cm-3. In comparison, the Sun's density is 1.409 g\u00a0cm-3.\nThe research team discovered NGTS-1b using the (NGTS), an array of telescopes physically located in Chile, which was designed to search for planets around bright stars. NGTS-1 is a relatively dim red M-dwarf, which are very common in the universe, of 15.52 \u00b1 0.08. University of Warwick professor Peter Wheatley, who runs the NGTS, said, \"NGTS-1b was difficult to find, despite being a monster of a planet, because its parent star is small and faint. Small stars are actually the most common in the universe, so it is possible there are many of these giant planets waiting to be found.\"\nTo date, scientists have discovered only three gas giants which revolves around M-dwarf stars. The other two are Kepler-45b and HATS-6b which have masses 0.505 MJ and 0.32 MJ respectively."}

Shortly after Welfare Minister announced on Friday his intentions to deploy Jewish workers on Shabbat for the railway work, Litzman, who belongs to the orthodox , informed Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu he would vacate his post on Sunday if Shabbat was sanctioned by the ministers.\nAddressing the Israeli citizens in a video statement, the health minister said, \"I cannot continue to bear ministerial responsibility as a minister of Israel while there is state-sanctioned public of Shabbat, in contravention of the sacred values of the Jewish people, the status quo and the coalition agreement\". Both welfare minister Haim Katz and transportation minister had expressed potential threat to passengers if the railway work was postponed.\nHaim Katz said he had considered the religious beliefs and public safety before making this call. On Friday, he said, \"after thorough examination, I authorised only essential work to ensure the safety of rail traffic, and if it were not carried out it could endanger lives [...] This decision reflects full consideration for the feelings of the religious public, on the one hand, and maintaining the routine of the train passengers on Sunday.\"\nThe minister also said delaying this work and doing it on a working day would cause inconvenience to many people and create traffic problems. In Litzman's statement, the health minister said, \"throughout the generations the Jewish people knew it must safeguard the Sabbath as a supreme value, and even to sacrifice one's life for it. The holy Sabbath is the national day of rest, and we were raised to protect against desecrating the Sabbath.\"\nLitzman, who became health minister in September 2015 following a ruling by prohibiting him from doing the job as a deputy minister, stated he is not leaving the coalition government. On Saturday, the prime minister's office in a statement said, \"the heads of the factions have clarified that they do not intend to leave the coalition\" while they were trying to figure out a way \"to both respect the Sabbath and ensure safe, consistent public transport\", indicating the coalition government would not be dissolved by Litzman's resignation.\nNetanyahu said he would take Litzman's vacated place while they try to bring Litzman back. , leader of the opposition , said, \"in a modern society, if you want trains to run all week, you have to do maintenance work on Shabbat[...] Litzman is a good minister, and his resignation shows that the Netanyahu government is finished.\"\nLitzman had discussed about working on Shabbat with religious leader , and was told it was wrong to work on Shabbat. Early in July, when prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu went to , France to attend former German chancellor 's funeral, Netanyahu walked from hotel to European Parliament, and he did not deliver a speech or sign a guestbook to avoid actions of work on the rest day.\nThis is not the first time the Isaeli government has had work done on Shabbat, but non-Jewish labourers were used to complete the task. According to reports, the task of installing the signalling system on the tracks required skilled workers, for whom substitutes were not available at the time. Israeli reported some German engineers were to arrive during the weekend for the signalling system installation work."}

It was on a complete whim, I just wanted to start, I just wanted to try out something new. I was reading this webcomic last year in June. And it is called \"Blue Chair\" by Shen and I decided, you know, might as well try making my own webcomic and that is actually when I got into it.\n Why did you name it \"Brown Paperbag\"?\n So, brown is a colour we associate with with Indians, and, on top of that, in these old cartoons, people used to put this brown paper bag on the top of their head with two eye holes and that symbolises shame or embarrassment, which is an overarching theme all over my comics.\n How much time do you take to write a comic?\n Comic typically takes around three hours. From idea to the final output. Three, three and half hours.\n I have read your comics and most of them are related to satire, but you never entered into politics. Why is that so?\n So, the thing is, most of the comics that I have read that are form Indians that are in newspapers are all political and not enough importance has been given to just Indian daily lives, just the families and how they interact with society. So I have decided to stay away from politics in this comic just because I am not trying to send a message across, I am just trying to appeal to people's nostalgia, make them remember something that they experienced and just relate to it.\n Who is your inspiration?\n When it comes to webcomics, my inspiration has to be Shen from \"Blue Chair\", and it is also called Shen Comics now. Then, \"The Awkward Yeti\" \u2014 Nick Seluk, then Sarah Andersen's comics \u2014 \"Sarah's Scribbles\". Yeah, those are pretty much it. I only read the mainstream ones before I decided to start making my own, So I don't have a long list. [Laughs]\n Where did you upload your first comic?\n Facebook.\n Are you self-taught?\n Yes! For the most part, yeah. I mean, I am studying animation design, but when it comes to drawing, I completely just taught myself.\n Do you discuss your ideas before penning them down?\n With some people. I have a couple of friends, I talk to sometimes, but for most ideas, no. I just go for it. Yeah.\n What tools do you use to create your comics?\n I draw in , and I use a Wiacom tablet.\n I wanted to know what is your official website.\n I don't have an official website but it is all over on Facebook or Instagram and even on Webtoons, but I don't have a website yet, but I am planning to start one soon.\n What are some of your hobbies?\n Oh, it is just drawing, animating. I play football, basketball, but mostly just drawing and animating.\n There is one character in your comic, which is called as[...] Kabeer. Why did you name him Kabeer?\n So Kabeer is a religiously ambiguous name. Kabeer isn't overly seen as a Hindu or a Muslim or anything. So it is a middle point and I wanted to keep a character that everyone can relate to, not just someone who belongs to a certain religion. So for that ambiguity, that is why I came up with the name, plus I really like the name. That was actually, probably the main reason.\n There is this comic which you have titled \"Folow my dreams, son\", which was about a boy who wanted to become a footballer, but ends up getting a degree from FFS College of Engineering. So were there some challenges with your...\n Absolutely not! My parents have been super supportive from the start. Like they actually told me to leave studies and go for art because I was so passionate about art and design. So I have had a very very smooth sailing so far. No parental pressure at all. It has been amazing, yeah.\n If you had something to tell to your younger self, about your webcomics, what would you tell?\n Read more. Right now I am reading a lot of different kinds of comics so I can look at different ways of story telling. If I had done that earlier, maybe I could have, maybe, I don't know, some stories could have turned out better. When I look at some of my older comics, I feel like, 'Okay this could have been done a little better' sometimes. So, that's it. Otherwise nothing. Like I said, I had a smooth life, I don't give a f...\n Would you mind if I take a photo?\n Absolutely not.\nInterview with freelancer comic writer John Layman.\n How did you get into comics?\n My first job, I moved to San Diego because that is where the comic book con is. After college, I moved to San Diego, at it was much smaller, but I didn't know how to get into comics because it was the pre internet or internet was just coming in to being and it was like 1990. So I got a job at the newspaper, and I would do geek stories. Whenever like had a TV show, or had a movie or the Comic Con rolled in town, I would write an article about it. And eventually I attracted attention of the local comic book company which was Jim Lee's WildStorm productions. They hired me as an assistant editor and then I worked my way up to editor, and then DC bought us. And suddenly I was a DC editor. So I had done that for about five years and then I had always wanted to write, I figured I knew how so I went freelance and then I started writing in about 2001. And I have been writing ever since.\n What other companies do you have worked for?\n DC, Marvel, Dark Horse, IDW, Avatar, Dark Horse, Dynamite, ...[a fellow volunteer suggests X-Men] well, companies, like Boom! I have basically worked for every, nearly every major comic book company in America.\n Why did you choose freelancing and not stick to one company?\n Because I don't want to work for a boss. I don't want to wear pants. I don't want people to tell me what to do. Like if I don't want a job, I can just [shows middle finger] you know, I can just walk away. But, it's hard because if you don't have work, you don't get paid. So you are always hustling. But there is a freedom of being your own boss.\n If you had an option, like, if there was no one to command you, would you still continue freelancing?\n I, no. I actually, a few years ago, I got a company job and after being freelancer, like no I don't wanna go into an office, I don't wanna do hours, like you get being used to be your own boss, I could never go back to a real job.\n Which is the first character you'd created when you were a kid?\n Oh! You know, I can't \u2014 that's been so long ago I don't even keep track that anymore. I mean I had some old dumb things that I don't even pay attention to anymore because I look back at them and they are so amateurish, you know I don't have a certain character I have created at an age that I remember.\n If you had something to tell something to your younger self, what would you tell?\n To my younger self? Just keep going. Because there's a lot of years where, you know, you are not making money and you are working real hard and you don't think you are ever gonna get there, but just keep at it, and you will get there.\n All these years, since the technology has taken over, how has the comic book industry changed in your opinion?\n Well, when I first started; it has got much easier, and it has gotten more global. Like I could work with someone in India and it wouldn't matter because with Wi-Fi and with e-mail and instant message, you know, the old days, you had to FedEx pages, and you had to scan them, and it would take literally twenty minutes to save a giant file on Photoshop and then you would have to upload film and then you would have to drive the film to FedEx. Now, everyone's got their own scanner. Everyone can do things by email. You can upload files by FTP. Like I work with people all around the world now, and before, you almost had to kind of work with the Americans and now its really easy to be global.\n Who was your inspiration?\n Um, and . They're both science fiction writers.\n Are you self-taught?\n Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, as an editor, I read scripts. Again and again and again and you read bad scripts and you read good scripts and you learn from everything. Like even a bad script can teach you what not to do. So I studied all the scripts I read and learned from that. And you learn from mistakes. You, sometimes you write a bad script and then you figure out what you did wrong, you do better next time.\n Which is your favourite superhero? \n Plastic Man. And Batman. And Spider-Man.\n If you had a chance to become a superhero, which one would you choose?\n Um, probably someone who could fly. Maybe someone who could be invisible. I don't wanna be Batman. Batman's got too many issues.\n What would you recommend to the new people getting into comic writing and drawing?\n Oh! Well that's two different questions. Like do you want to write? My advice is figure out what you want to do and then focus on that because some people try to do everything and they don't do it well because they are trying to do everything. So figure out really what you want to do and just fine-tune that.\n Would you mind if I take a photo?\n No, of course not. Yeah."}

They used , the same method that was used to create in 1996.\nIn somatic cell nuclear transfer, scientists remove the , which is the organelle that contains the , from an unfertilized , or egg cell, and implant the nucleus from a , or non-reproductive cell, into that ovum. The ovum is then stimulated and develops in the normal way, growing into a whole organism that has the same nuclear DNA as the donor organism, though it will have all of the ovum's and other cellular machinery. Clones like these have been described as identical twins to their donors, but younger.\nThe scientists implanted 21 into surrogate mother monkeys, resulting in six pregnancies, two of which produced living animals. The young clones were named both derived from , the Chinese-language word for the Chinese people. They are both , or crab-eating macaques (\"Macaca fascicularis\"). The scientists also attempted to clone macaques using nuclei from adult donors. They implanted 42 surrogates, resulting in 22 pregnancies, but there were still only two infant macaques, and they died soon after birth. The Scotland-based team that created Dolly the sheep in 1996 required 277 attempts and produced only one lamb.\nGenerally, the older the donor organism, the more difficult it is to get the DNA from the harvested nucleus to reactivate the genes that allow the clone organism to grow. Previous efforts to clone (\"Macaca mulatta\") using have been successful, but the current attempt used significantly older donors: fetal , which are key cells in connective tissue, and adult monkey .\n\"We're excited \u2014 extremely excited,\" said study co-author . \"This is really, I think, a breakthrough for biomedicine.\" He went on to say that the cloned monkeys could be used as test subjects for the study of neurological diseases such as and 's.

It's a major advance,\" agreed reproductive biologist Dieter Egli of . \"It should be possible to make models of human disease in those monkeys and study those and then attempt to cure it.\"\nAbout 90% of the laboratory animals used in the United States are rodents. Although the first cloned mouse was born in 1998, cloned mice are not currently common in laboratory settings. This may be because producing inbred mouse lines is still relatively effective.\nAlthough the announcement raised enthusiasm from researchers, it also drew caution from . \"Cloning one individual in the image of another really sort of demeans the significance of us as individuals,\" says Harvard Medical School's Dr. George Daley, speaking specifically of cloning humans. \"There's a certain sort of gut sense that it violates sort of natural norms.\" While Muming Poo concedes it is now theoretically possible to clone a human, he says his lab has no plans to do so. \nAlthough somatic cell nuclear transfer was used successfully in amphibians as early as 1952, getting it to work in mammals took much longer. Dolly, the first cloned mammal, was born in 1996. Teams have been trying to clone monkeys for decades, but primate DNA is notoriously difficult to work with. \"The trick is we choose the right chemicals to turn on these genes we transfer into the egg,\" Mu-ming Poo told the press. \"So that's what we did different. I think that's the key.\" One of the agents used to treat the ova was messenger RNA from the human gene."}

Canada's largest convention by attendance, the annual event offers dozens of subculture-specific programs.\nThe convention's communications and public relations coordinator for the event, Ronnie, describes furries as \"people that enjoy arts and culture centred around animals and animal-themed topics, essentially. Furnal Equinox in particular, we like to celebrate in a very visual and very [...] artistic nature, where we have lots of arts and performances and crafts that go on, and people celebrate with lots of socialisation involved.\"\nOf the attendees, Ronnie told Wikinews \"they come from all walks of life. They are people of all ages, sizes, all sorts of backgrounds, and they come together under one mutual interest, which is their love for animal culture.\"\n\"Programming at Furnal Equinox involves[...] a lot of informational panels, so you can find out about topics from art and how to draw, or how to visually incorporate different elements into your artworks. You can also find panels that teach you how to write better, be a better fiction author for example,\" explained the event representative.\nAt one panel Wikinews attended, members of its all-volunteer organising committee spoke of the year-long process of planning the event, and their reasons for committing such a significant amount of their time. Said one panelist, \"if you're happy, we're happy.\"\nThe largest hub of activity at the convention was a dealer's room; nicknamed the \"Dealer's Den\", giving it an anthropomorphic twist. Vendors were selling original visual art, wearables like faux fur tails or ears, or things like jewellery or soap with motifs that would interest attendees.\nThe back area of the room was dedicated to a charity auction, with proceeds benefiting Happily Ever Esther Farm Sanctuary. According to the convention website, the charity is \"dedicated to rescuing abused, neglected, and abandoned farmed animals. Their goal is to provide a safe, life-long home for all of their residents, and to educate the public about the true nature of farmed animals through tours, volunteer programs, and community outreach.\"\nSplit into groups, some attendees played \"Fursuit Games\" in front of an audience, like trying to toss a ball into a garbage can. The activity made harder, of course, by the limited dexterity and vision the most of the costumes entail.\nAttendees in fursuit.\nOnly 10\u201315% of people within the fandom own a fursuit, according to a 2011 study, contrary to the impression that this photo montage may give."}

Ryan took over the Speaker position after John Boehner retired in 2015. Ryan cited wanting to spend more time with his three children. Some reports suggested he was also disillusioned with the Trump presidency. Ryan contradicted this in public: \"I'm grateful to the president for giving us this opportunity to do big things to get this country on the right track,\" he said. According to , Ryan considered last December's restructuring of the U.S. tax code to be the most important accomplishment during his time as Speaker.\nPresident Trump said via Twitter, \"Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question.

Most launches have a roughly two-hour period during which the mission can be executed, but this one had a window of only thirty seconds because this satellite must use the Moon's gravity to reach the desired orbit.\nTESS is slated to enter a high orbit distinct from the geosynchronous orbits used by many other satellites. TESS instrument scientist Joel Villasenor, also of MIT, explained, \"The Moon and the satellite are in a sort of dance. The Moon pulls the satellite on one side, and by the time TESS completes one orbit, the Moon is on the other side tugging in the opposite direction. The overall effect is the Moon's pull is evened out, and it's a very stable configuration over many years. Nobody's done this before, and I suspect other programs will try to use this orbit later on.\"\nIf all goes according to plan, TESS will circle the Earth for 60 days to establish its 13.7-day orbit and test its machinery before beginning its mission: using its four cameras to analyze stars for decreases in brightness that may be caused by a planet passing between us and them, a technique called the .

TESS is designed to cover 400 times as much of the sky as Kepler, and is capable of viewing 85% of the sky. Scientists expect it to find 1500 planets during its two-year mission, 300 Earth-like, but believe it may find many more.\nBecause TESS's cameras can cover a wide range of radiant energy, including infrared, scientists believe it may be able to detect planets orbiting , which scientists consider likely to host rocky, Earth-like planets with the right mass for an atmosphere and the right temperature to host liquid water, a range called the .\nThe data collected by TESS are to be publicly accessible so anyone who wishes may participate in the search.

All eight accused for Bano's rape and death are Hindus, of which two are police officials.\nBano's father approached the Supreme Court requesting the case be shifted to a different court, suggesting . Some of the accused asked the case be heard in Jammu and Kashmir. Bano's family and their lawyer, Deepika Singh Rajawat, had received death threats and personal threats. The Supreme Court, headed by , , ordered continuing security for the victim's family as well as the lawyer. They also ordered continuing security for the juvenile accused for Bano's rape and death.\nStating fair trial is a \" principle under Article 21\" of the Indian constitution, which corresponds to the fundamental right to life, the Supreme Court said, \"We are transferring the case to Pathankot from Kathua for trial [...] the case will be heard daily so that the verdict can be reached in a country where such cases can run for years or decades\". Pathankot is a district in Punjab, and it is about 30 (about 20 ) from Kathua. The Supreme Court also ordered the hearing sessions cannot be adjourned and in-camera to ensure the safety of witnesses. There are about 221 witnesses for this case. Statements in are to be translated in English. The Supreme Court instructed Pathankot's district judge not to transfer the case to any other court.\nThree of the accused, Sanjhi Ram, Vishal Jangotra, and Parvesh Kumar asked for a probe by the . Dismissing the plea, the Supreme Court said, \"When charge sheet is filed, why should we want another agency?\"\nPer the charge sheet filed by Jammu and Kashmir police on April 9, Asifa Bano was raped at a place of worship.\nLast month, after protests against the rape and murder of Asifa Bano in various cities across the nation, Indian ministers passed an ordinance allowing the death sentence for those convicted of raping a girl under the age of twelve. However, per Article 20 (1) of the Indian Constitution, the ordinance is not applicable in this case. Article 20 (1) states, \"No person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of the act charged as an offence, nor be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence.\"\nThe trial is to be conducted in accordance with the (RPC). Due to special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir mentioned in Article 370 of the constitution, the Ranbir Penal Code is applicable for Jammu and Kashmir; since the case falls in the of that state. The RPC, which is different from the (IPC), has been in effect since before Indian independence from Great Britain}, when of the was the king of the then-independent state. Deepika Singh Rajawat, the lawyer who took Asifa Bano's case said, \"There is not much difference between IPC and RPC, especially for rape and murder. Even though the order of sections are different, that would not affect the hearing of the Kathua case.\"\nThe next hearing is scheduled for July 9."}

Political agents are responsible for providing governmental services and judiciary under Article 247 of the Pakistani Constitution.\nBefore January 12, when a bill extended to FATA the writ of the Pakistani Supreme Court and Peshawar High Court, the tribal area was out of the of the Pakistani courts. Collective punishment of a tribe can be declared under the , the code applicable to the seven districts. Per the rules dating back to the colonial era, FATA citizens do not enjoy all the rights under the Constitution of Pakistan that other Pakistanis are entitled to.\nPrime Minister Abbasi said, \"This is the start of a process, not the end of one. We need to gain the trust of the people of FATA, and that trust will not come just through words\". He later added, \"We have to give the people of FATA the same schools, the same colleges, the same universities, the same hospitals, the same roads and the system as is available to everyone else in Pakistan. There should be no difference there.\"\nIf the bill is passed, it is expected to change the first article of the Pakistani Constitution, which defines the territory of Pakistan, listing FATA separately from the other provinces. Article 246, which defines the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, would be modified and Article 247, which gives the guidelines to administer all the tribal areas including FATA, is expected to be removed once the merger bill is approved. The bill grants FATA citizens the right to elect their representatives in national and provincial assemblies.\nThe bill states the National Assembly seats are to be reduced from 342 to 336; the Senate is to be reduced from 104 to 96 seats. The change of the number of seats in both the houses of parliament occurs in Articles 51 and 59 of the Constitution which direct the number of seats available for those houses. The bill also says FATA is to hold 21 seats in the Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Assembly.\nMilitant groups Pakistani Taliban and al Qaeda have operated in FATA for years, and military actions were carried out since 2008 to usurp militant groups' control over the area and restore Pakistani control.\n party leader Dr called for a referendum to make FATA a separate province and explained their support for the current bill as \"for the sake of political unity\". \"We fear that if Fata is merged with KP, it will get difficult to create a new province in the future\", Sattar commented. Calling it a \"black day\", JUI-F's representative Jamaluddin said the parties had voted to \"usurp the rights of the people of Fata\".\nPrime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said, \"Today this house has approved a historic bill, which will have very positive effects for Pakistan.\" The merger bill needs to be approved by at least two thirds of the members of KP's assembly. Per Article 239 (4) of the constitution, any bill which may lead to constitutional amendment and alter provincial boundaries requires at least a two-thirds majority from the provincial assembly before it is presented to the President."}

The bill was passed with 92\u20137 votes, achieving more than the mandatory two-thirds majority.\nThe \"Federally Administered Tribal Areas Reforms Bill, 2018\", which seeks to end the colonial-era rules which are applicable to the five million people living in FATA, was approved by the federal lower house, the , on Thursday, and by the upper house \u2014 the \u2014 on Friday. In the Provincial Assembly, , who serves as Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister, tabled the bill. Out of 124 total votes, the bill required at least 83 votes for a two-thirds majority. Only seven members of the opposition (JUI-F) voted against the bill.\nSince Pakistani independence from British rule in 1947, the Pakistani President has appointed \"Political Agents\" to govern FATA, who exercise near-complete autonomous control over the areas. These agents are responsible for providing government and judicial services under Article 247 of the Pakistani Constitution. Before January 12, when a bill extended the writ of both the Pakistani Supreme Court and to FATA, the tribal areas were outside the jurisdiction of the Pakistani courts.

If removed, (PATA) citizens would lose certain privileges and incentives. Members of KP Provincial Assembly from the division (the PATA) including , , Dr , and expressed their dissatisfaction with the purging of incentives for PATA. Those assembly members also asked for exemption of taxes for PATA citizens. Chief Minister Pervez Khattak said he would raise the concerns with the Federal Government, requesting a ten-year tax exemption for PATA citizens.\nAbout a hundred protesters protested in the morning in front of the Assembly building. Police officer Kamal Hussein said six police officials were injured in the clash as JUI-F members and supporters threw stones towards the policeman. Hussein added they used tear gas to disperse the crowd. A dozen JUI-F members were arrested in the clash. Some protestors were saying, \"We will not let the FATA merger bill be approved\". JUI-F's Maulana Lutfur Rehman said the tribal people should be given the chance to decide about the merger. According to the police report, the protestors also threatened to lock the gates of the Assembly building to prevent the assembly scheduled for 2 PM, local time. Lawmaker condemned the protests.\nChief Minister Khattak said he \"wondered why PkhMAP [] chairman Mahmood Khan Achakzai, whose party is just limited to certain districts of Balochistan, is opposing the merger of FATA into KP\". The provincial assembly voted for the bill before the assembly was scheduled to dissolve on May 29 at 12 AM, local time, with the administration reaching completion of its five-year term.\nPer the Bill, the five million citizens of FATA, which consists of seven main tribal agencies and six smaller , will gain the right to vote for representatives in the KP Provincial Assembly and the National Assembly.\nThe bill, which is expected to be the 31st amendment to the Pakistani Constitution, now requires the President's signature to pass. It was first cleared by the Provincial Assembly due to article 239 (4) of the Pakistani Constitution, which states that any bill which may lead to a constitutional amendment and alter provincial boundaries requires at least a two-thirds majority from the affected provincial assembly before it is presented to the President."}

The bill was presented to the president by Senate Chairman on Tuesday for the president's assent. President Hussain's approval for the 25th Constitutional Amendment will remove mention of \"FATA\" from the Constitution.\nSince Pakistani independence from British rule in 1947, the Pakistani President had been appointing \"Political Agents\" to govern FATA, who exercised near-complete autonomous control over the areas.

The bill includes changes in the legislative area. KP is to have 55 seats in the country's National Assembly, and the Senate size is to be decreased to 96 from 104 by 2024.

The research team reviewed dozens of previous papers, compiled their findings into a database, and performed spatial analysis with the aggregate shark-related event data. Results showed the sharks' frequented sites had areas of very shallow water near a steep drop-off into the depths, such as a or slope.\nThe whale shark can grow to eighteen (60 ) in length. Unlike its better-known relatives, the and other predatory , the whale shark is a , meaning that it draws water into its mouth and extracts small organisms from the liquid. They can search for food at the surface of the ocean but are also known to dive deep. According to supervising author Dr Bryce Stewart, PhD, \"Sharks are ectotherms, which means they depend on external sources of body heat. Because they may dive down to feed at depths of more than 1900 metres, where the water temperature can be as cold as four degrees, they need somewhere close by to rest and get their body temperature back up. Steep slopes in the seabed also cause an upwelling of sea currents that stimulate and small crustaceans such as that the whale sharks feed on.\"\nSuch sites are also attractive to fishing and recreational boating, and collisions can injure sharks. Stewart emphasized the importance of using research to help preserve and protect the sharks, calling them, \"extremely valuable to local people on the coastlines where they gather, which are often in developing countries. While a whale shark can be worth as much as $250,000 dead, alive it can provide more than $2 Million USD over the course of its life span.\" The latter figure specifically estimates only ecotourism."}

The (MEA) denounced the 49-page report by the UN Office of the , calling it \"selective\", \"malicious\" and \"fallacious\". The report mentions human rights violations including torture, enforced disappearances, sexual violations, administrative detention, violations on the right to health and education, lack of access to justice and arbitrary arrests and detention among others.\n, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said he would urge the UN Human Rights Council \"to consider establishing a Commission of Inquiry to conduct a comprehensive independent international investigation into allegations of human rights violation in Kashmir\". Hussein was not granted permission, by either India or Pakistan, to visit Kashmir for the report.\nPer the report, Pakistan was asked to stop \"misuse of anti-terror legislation to persecute those engaging in peaceful political and civil activities and those who express dissent.\" In July 2016, Indian security forces killed the leader , which led to protests in the Kashmir Valley. In response to the protests, Indian security forces fired metallic pellets, and their activities led to human rights violation, the UN report read. It also accused India of the unlawful killing of about 145 civilians since 2016. The report asked India to \"fully respect the right of self-determination of the people of Kashmir as protected under international law.\"\nThe MEA issued a statement which read: \"India rejects the report. It is fallacious, tendentious and motivated. We question the intent in bringing out such a report. It is a selective compilation of largely unverified information. It is overtly prejudiced and seeks to build a false narrative.\" Per the constitution of Jammu and Kashmir it \"is and shall be an integral part of the Union of India\" while Pakistan's constitution does not mention Azad Kashmir or Gilgit-Baltistan in its territories, but has a provision for relations with Pakistan subject to Jammu and Kashmir people's decision to acceede to Pakistan. The MEA added in their statement, \"Cross-border terror and incitement are aimed at suppressing the will of the people of Jammu &amp; Kashmir, disrupting its political and social fabric and undermining India's integrity\".\nUnlike India, the report was welcomed by Pakistan. In a press release, the Foreign Office said Pakistan \"welcomes the proposal by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to establish a Commission of Inquiry for [an] international investigation into human rights violations\" in Indian-held Kashmir.\nDirecting towards Indian authorities, the report asked to \"urgently repeal the Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act, 1990; and, in the meantime, immediately remove the requirement for prior central government permission to prosecute security forces personnel accused of human rights violations in civilian courts\".\n\"The report violates India's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The entire state of Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India. Pakistan is in illegal and forcible occupation of a part of the Indian state through aggression. We have repeatedly called upon Pakistan to vacate the occupied territories. The incorrect description of Indian territory in the report is mischievous, misleading and unacceptable. There are no entities such as 'Azad Jammu and Kashmir' and 'Gilgit-Baltistan'\", India's External Affairs ministry said in their statement.\nThe report was welcomed by some activists and leaders in Kashmir. Jammu and Kashmir human rights activist Khurram Parvez welcomed the UN report. Kashmiri leader wrote on Twitter, \"People of Kashmir thank the U.N., especially the bold efforts of its HR commissioner, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, for its support to the right of self-determination.\"\nThe Kashmir-conflict between India and Pakistan has led to two wars since their independence in 1947. Between 1990 and 2017, there have been about 69,820 militancy-related incidents in Jammu and Kashmir, and more than 41 thousand people were killed.

The ministry, in a statement, said, \"The defense against illegal immigration imposes a heavy burden on Hungary's budget, so it indirectly affects the Hungarian people [...] therefore, the government passes that as a manner of burden sharing, the organisations aiding migration should bear additional taxes.\"\nUNHCR ()'s European Bureau director Pascale Moreau said, \"Seeking asylum is a fundamental human right, it is not a crime\"."}

Mars's rocky, subterranean layer once, for some hundreds of millions of years, had enough water and reductants to support some of the same kinds of microbial communities seen on Earth.\n\"We showed, based on basic physics and chemistry calculations, that the ancient Martian subsurface likely had enough dissolved hydrogen to power a global subsurface biosphere,\" reported lead author and current Brown graduate student Jesse Tarnas. The paper does not claim life on Mars did exist but rather that conditions suitable for life are very likely to have lasted for an extended time. This habitable zone, located beneath Mars's then-frozen surface, would have reached several kilometers into Mars's surface, potentially protected by ice above.\nThe study showed that, during Mars's (4.1\u20133.7 billion years ago), , the process by which radiation splits water molecules apart, produced enough hydrogen gas (H2) for microbial organisms to live on so long as they remained within the area just beneath the cryosphere, the SHZ (subcryospheric highly-fractured zone). The concentration of hydrogen in the groundwater could have ranged from about 35 to about 55 depending on whether ancient Mars was warm or cold, respectively, and higher if the subsurface medium also contained enough salt. The researchers determined this by establishing three factors. First, they examined data from the gamma ray spectrometer aboard NASA's , from which they inferred how much of various radioactive elements would have been present in Mars's crust during the Noachian, and therefore how much radiation would have been available to split water and so produce hydrogen. They then built on existing models of water flow on Mars to determine how much groundwater would have been present. Third, they used climate and geothermal modeling to determine how much of that water would have been in liquid form and at a suitable temperature for living things.\nIn subterranean environments on Earth called , or SLiMEs, ecosystems sustain themselves not on plants that harness sunlight through photosynthesis but on microbes that harvest electrons from nearby molecules. Molecular hydrogen is an especially good electron donor.\nOne of the study authors, Brown Professor John Mustard, is on the team designing the next mission, scheduled for 2020. He and Tarnas recommended the Rover examine the sites of meteorite crashes, which may have excavated rocks from this possibly habitable depth that may hold traces of ancient life."}

She took the test in response to a dare from U.S. President Donald Trump, who promised at a rally this July to donate USD1 million to a worthy cause if she could prove she had Native American genes, as she claimed.\nWarren on Monday reminded Trump of his offer publicly on Twitter: \"By the way, @realDonaldTrump: Remember saying on 7/5 that you'd give $1M to a charity of my choice if my DNA showed Native American ancestry? I remember \u2013 and here's the verdict. Please send the check to the National Indigenous Women's Resource Center\".\nTrump responded by telling the press \"I didn't say that. You better read it again.\" He later added he would only write the check if he could personally test Warren's DNA himself, adding \"That will not be something I enjoy doing, either.\"\nAn aide to Warren said her DNA was collected in August. It was tested by professor and genetics expert , who . Accoriding to Bustamante's report, \"While the vast majority of the individual's ancestry is European, the results strongly support the existence of an unadmixed Native American ancestor in the individual's pedigree, likely in the range of 6-10 generations ago.\" Bustamante himself told the press about a stretch of genes on Warren's 10th chromosome. \"We found five segments, and that long segment was pretty significant. It tells us about one ancestor, and we can't rule out more ancestors. [...] We are confident it is not an error.\"\nChuck Hoskin Jr., Secretary of State of the , voiced a concern: \"Using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation, even vaguely, is inappropriate and wrong. [...] Senator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage.\"\nDemocratic strategist told the press, \"She is most clearly doing the things you do if you're running for president.\"\nTeaching from 1987 to 1995 at the , Warren identified there as Native American, and again at , where she served as a professor. This fact re-emerged during her 2012 campaign for the senate, drawing some criticism. President Trump has sarcastically referred to Senator Warren by the nickname \"\" after the famous chief's daughter. Warren has said she identified as Native American during that part of her life because that was when her older female relatives were dying and she wanted to feel closer to her family history. Warren said on Monday via Twitter, \"DNA &amp; family history has nothing to do with tribal affiliation or citizenship, which is determined only \u2013 only \u2013 by Tribal Nations. I respect the distinction, &amp; don't list myself as Native in the Senate.\"\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, universities like Harvard and Penn were under pressure to show they had minorities on staff. Warren recently released employment documents to \"The Boston Globe\" that reportedly indicated her purported ethnicity did not affect her career.\nWarren's family's history names a great-great-great grandmother called O.C. Sarah Smith. She is listed as white on period documents, but Warren's family maintained she was, in some degree, Native American.\nBustamante's report notes searching DNA for Native American ancestry is difficult because the databases of known Native American DNA to which to compare samples are relatively small. Some tribal authorities have asked their members not to participate in genetic studies because of exploitation and misuse by scientists in the past. In one case, beginning in 1989, hundreds of provided blood samples to researchers from the University of Arizona who claimed they were performing a study on , from which many Havasupai suffered. The donors later learned their samples were used not only for diabetes but for other disease studies and for migration studies that contradicted the tribe's traditional stories about its origin. This was without the donors' knowledge or permission, in violation of standard medical ethics. This led to the \"\" lawsuit, which was settled in 2010. Warren's sample was tested against samples from Mexico and South America believed to have genetic markers in common with Native Americans from what is now the United States."}

Asia Bibi is a Christian who was sentenced to death by hanging in November 2010 and remained in confinement on death row for the past eight years awaiting a final decision, reportedly much of it in solitary confinement.\nHeaded by the Chief Justice , the bench composed of three judges ruled the prosecution \"categorically failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt\" and Bibi was freed from the charges. In the 56-page-long decision, the Supreme Court said, \"This appeal is allowed. The judgements of the High Court, as well as the Trial Court, are reversed. Consequently, the conviction as also the sentence of death awarded to the appellant is set aside and she is acquitted of the charge\".\nIn 2009, two Muslim women accused Bibi of defaming Islamic prophet . Bibi was arrested under 295-C of the after local cleric Qari Mohammad Salaam registered a formal complaint against Bibi. Blasphemy against Islam is punishable by death or by life imprisonment. Bibi's case was appealed in the Supreme Court after Lahori upheld her conviction in 2014.\nFollowing the verdict, a (TLP) leader, Afzal Qadri, said \"[The judges] who have ordered the release of the accursed Asia [Bibi] are all liable to be killed under religious edict\". Demonstrations broke out in various cities across the country after the verdict. Another leader of TLP, Khadim Rizvi, said he would \"paralyse the country within hours\" if Bibi was acquitted and set free.\nA main high-way in Pakistan's capital Islamabad and several roads in Karachi and Punjab province's capital Lahore were obstructed by supporters of TLP and other religious groups sparking disordered traffic jams. Per the local reports, governments of three provinces \u2014 , Punjab, and Sindh\u2014 had imposed section 144 which prevented gathering of more than four people in public. Section 144 was imposed till November 10.\nThe verdict of Bibi's case was welcomed by Amnesty International. South Asia director deputy Omar Waraich said, \"Justice has finally prevailed. The message must go out that the blasphemy laws will no longer be used to persecute the country's most vulnerable minorities\". Christians account for about one and a half percent of the population of Pakistan. In 2010, then Catholic Pope Benedict XVI called for Bibi's release.\nRegarding the blockades in various cities and the threats against the judges, Pakistani Prime Minister addressed the public via TV broadcast and said, \"Which government can function when people say that kill the judges, rebel against the army chief? [...] If the Supreme Court does not issue a verdict according to their wishes, does that mean they will come out on the roads and paralyse the country?\"\nPrime Minister Imran Khan also said, \"They are inciting you for their own political gain, you should not get trapped by them for the sake of the country, they are doing no service to Islam [...] We will protect people's properties and lives, we will not allow any sabotage, we will not allow any traffic to be stopped\". He supported the Supreme Court decision and said it was \"according to the constitution [of Pakistan] and Pakistan's constitution is according to the teachings of Islam\".\nAfter the verdict was announced, Bibi told \"Agence France-Presse\", \"I can't believe what I am hearing, will I go out now? Will they let me out, really?\""}

So Mr O'Sullian, could you tell us something about yourself?\n My name is Ryan O' Sullivan. I am a comic book writer from the UK. I have written books such as \"Void Trip\" for Image Comics, \"Fearscape\" for Vault Comics, as well as a lot of video game-based comics, like ', ', \"\", \"Eisenhorn\". So that's me in a nutshell.\n How old are you, and when did you start writing comics?\n I am in my 30s, and I started writing comics, ah, well I don't know, I have been writing all my life, but I have done it professionally for, I'll say, two years now. Maybe three.\n How was your first job like?\n My first \u2014 my \"first\" job? Oh boy! [Laughs] That was um, it was interesting. So the first comic that I did was called \"Turncoat\", and that was purely online. So that everyday, we'd put another page of the comic out. And that's how I got known because people go online, they'd read the comic, and then after a certain amount of time, we'd collect it all together in a big comic, and they say that the first time you do a comic, you should make it small, you do a few pages just to learn it. But for mine, I did it for a hundred and sixty four pages And I'm thrown in at the deep end, and somehow I managed to swim. But it was, it was pretty stressful, but was very fun[?].\n Well, so how many companies have you worked with?\n Oh! Um... I would say around half a dozen, at a guess [...] Image Comics, I have worked with Vault Comics, I've worked with T-Pub: that's a small UK publisher. I've worked with Titan Comics. And what's interesting is with the video game comics, that means I've worked with a lot of other companies as well, like video game companies, so, , , . I feel I'm missing people out now, just 'cause it's quite a lot. But yeah, it's been a lot of people. But I would say, of them all, if I could talk to fourteen-year-old Ryan, and tell him what his future would be like, the thing that might excite him the most is the fact that I wrote a comic for Warhammer and , because that's what was my jam as a kid.\n So, would you classify yourself as a freelancer?\n I would say so, yeah.\n And do you plan just working for a company, or would you like to carry on freelancing?\n I enjoy freelancing, because it gives me the freedom to work whenever I want, and do whatever projects I like. And no one person is in-charge of me, and that's really fun.\n What does a normal day at work look for you?\n I wake up. I have coffee. I write all day, until I can't write anymore. Then I have more coffee. Then I read until I can't read anymore. And then I fall asleep. Seven days in the week. That's my life. Sometimes I escape to ComicCons like this.\n What are the changes in the comic book industry that you have noticed?\n I've noticed that a lot of diverse voices are becoming more prominent recently. And I think that's, it's because I think in society in general, diverse voices from different cultures, different backgrounds, different sort of sects and preferences and whatnot are becoming a lot more prominent in general. And with comics being on the edge, the fringe medium, that tends to accumulate whatever is coming, a lot quicker than say film or other mediums. So I think that new voices is one big thing, one big part of comics. And also, diversification of how it is published. So now it's not just comics in comics stores, you've also got bookstores, you've got online, you've got digital, you've got web-comics like I told you, that I did. So there's a lot more avenues for people to get involved, make their own comics, [...]. I mean, ComicCon India is an exact example of the growing comic market.\n Who was your favourite super-hero?\n My favourite super-hero is actually a super-villain. . Because he is just the biggest badass ever. He's inspired so many villains. He inspired Darth Vader. The guy is just the coolest character ever. So I have not had a chance to write him yet, but if I do, I have got a few stories up my sleeve.\n Do you have some head-cannons regarding that and you will write fan-fiction about it?\n I don't write fan-fiction, but I do have a few ideas in my head for how [Doctor] Doom could play.\n Could you brief me about the process from, how an idea comes, and goes to the publication, and it is in the hands of any reader?\n You mean like,how does it go from being an idea in my head to a comic in someone's hand? Okay; well, typically, I will come up with an idea and you don't know where you get your ideas from, they appear out of the blue, just jump into your brain, and if they stay around for a while, you can't get rid of them just by ignoring them, that means you have to write them. So what happens usually is I will write on a one-page sheet, of what the comics is about, what my idea for the story would be. And then I find an artist who likes that idea, and I team with them, and I write the script, and the artists will take the scripts off me and draw it, and I will say, \"Okay, first page, I want a picture of \"this\", picture of \"this\", \"this\" dialogue, and \"this\" dialogue.\" And then, once we have created the first issue, we'll send that to a publisher, they will proof[read] it, check the spelling mistakes, there's not many of them. And what they do it to print it and send it out to stores. So that would be the \"short-and-sweet\" way it works.\n Well so, how to you maintain continuity and fluidity of the story across the pages?\n By being very diligent before I write it. So if I've, I am a big believer that you should outline everything. So before I write the script I've got it all planned out, I know which character's gonna go where; so that I don't have to make it up and hope I can remember what's all going to happen. If I have got it all laid out, \"okay, Issue #1 \"this\" happens. Issue #2 \"this\" happens.\" I have got a flow chart of all the characters and where they are. That, it might be a bit overkill but for me, it keeps it all. Of course, when I sit down to write, then I just ignore it and do whatever I want. But yeah, outlining is the way to make sure the story flows the way I want it to.\n Do you enjoy movie adaptations of comics?\n I do, yeah. For different reasons. I like, I really enjoy \"\". I know it's not a movie, but, actually, no, it is! There a movie coming out. I really enjoy that because, what I find fascinating is it is very different from the comic, but it appeals to the same idea, the same feel. Because in comic, certain characters set stories, and in the show, they put the same stories, but they mix all the characters up, like who is doing what, so you still don't know who's going to die, who is going to be the hero, who is going to be the villain, and I like that unpredictability. I don't like the idea of taking a comic and making it exactly the same in the film. I think that you should translate it to a new medium and use that new medium to its most potential. So, yeah, I really enjoy them a lot. Ah, and yeah, obviously the Marvel films too.\n Who were your mentors?\n My mentors? Me. I am my mentor. Because a lot of comics is self-learned. But if you would say \"Who inspires me?\", \"Which writers?\" I would say, , and . [...] They're probably the writers who, essentially any writer who is angry, and argues a lot in their books, they are the ones I tend to like. I think, okay, I think \"\" is probably my real, my real influence.\n If you could travel back in time, what advice would you give to your younger self?\n [Pauses for a while] \"Stop partying so much, go home, and write. Because it takes ages, and you are going to regret [all] this time spent partying. Because ultimately what you want to do with your life, Ryan, isn't party, it's to write. So get on with it.\" That's what I'ld tell twenty-year-old Ryan. But I'd tell fourteen-year-old Ryan: \"Ignore mum and dad. Keep playing video games; it's gonna help in the long run.\"\n Do you mind if I take a photo of yours?\n Yeah, by all means!\nInterview with English comic book writer Dan Watters.\n Thank you for agreeing to the interview.\n So, would you mind telling us about yourself?\n Um, Okay. I'm Dan Watters. I am currently writing ' for . And \"Deep Roots\" for Vault Comics. I've done series for ', for \"\". \"Limbo\" was my first book, at .\n How old are you and when did you start writing comics?\n I am 27. And my first book came out in 2015. So for about three years, I have been doing it professionally.\n What drew you into comics, and who was the major influence for you to start writing comics?\n Oh man! I originally thought I was gonna get into film-making, but that's such a slow and arduous process, and sort of relinquish control to so many people because of such a big team and everything, that I sort of fell into comics as something where you, where the writer has a little bit more control, like, directly. Major influence-wise, I was a huge fan of old-school Vertigo stuff: say, \"\", \"Lucifer\", \"Swamp Thing\", \"Doom Patrol\": those were the books that really made me want to write.\n What was your first job like?\n My first comics job? [...] Ah, well, Caspar Wijngaard the artist and I pitched \"Limbo\" to Image Comics, in-person at a festival, a ComicCon, in the UK called Thought Bubble, and, we got the go ahead, to go away and make that book, but we were brand-new, we had no idea of what we were doing. And we entirely had to essentially work, or feel our way through. So we weren't doing a book that had an editor, or had other people in charge. It was just the two of us making this book, which was just amazing and terrifying, but such a sort of trial by fire as far as these things go so there's no one to tell us how to do things things, but it was great, I mean, really happy how the book came out.\n How has the times changed since then?\n Well, now I am working with a, because I have done a lot of work stuff on licensed works, doing stuff which is other people's properties: so be it big franchises, like \"Assassin's Creed\" and \"Wolfenstein\" where it's very well established things that you have to sort of, you know, there's certain fan expectations in that and things that you need to, things you need to have. To something like \"Lucifer\" which I am doing now, which is a spin-off of \"Sandman\", so it's worlds, that I'm writing. And so it's a big difference between writing from something that's entirely your own and you can do anything with it; and writing something that's someone else's that has the weight of history, you know, has a weight of series history behind it. But, I enjoy all of it.\n So, you are a freelancer, right?\n Yes.\n Do you plan on fixing to one job or do you wish to continue freelancing?\n Yeah, I think, I think most comics creators tend to work freelancing, and it's a really nice was of doing it. It's a really nice to have a balance between making your own stuff from scratch, and working on other things where you don't have to worry about the sort of world-building and creating everything, explaining everything. To sort of jump in to someone else's sandpit is really freeing sometimes as well. So I wanna keep doing both, as much as possible. And I want to work in other mediums: I want to write plays, I want to write novels. I want to write everything.\n How does a normal day of work look like?\n [Chuckles] I kind of try and like trick myself into thinking that there's no such thing as a \"normal day\", but there really is. Because I am a freelancer, I could just sit home the whole day, but the idea of that is horrific. So I try [to] get up and get out as early as I can in the morning, which doesn't necessarily mean super early. [Laughs] But I get up and go out. I spend way too much money in coffee shops, because I go work in a coffee shop: just sit there for like hours with my laptop, like a proper writer's clich\u00e9.\n Other than writing what else do you prefer to do?\n I mean, writing is kind of a black hole, in that everything sort of ends up getting pulled into it. So, I mean I love to read, I always have. If I am left alone for an hour, what I want to do is read. The other thing that I've got quite into this year is rock climbing but I'm not very good at it. But it's a really nice thing that turns off, it's the only thing I know that turns off that side of my brain, that turns of the right side, there's so much problem-solving that you can't think of other stuff while you are doing it. So I really enjoy that.\n How has the significance of comics changed over the years?\n Oh, now, how long have you got? It's a difficult question, because, the industry, I have heard people talking: you get a lot of angry people on Twitter talking about the dying industry and everything, but it's just, I think, working out, what it needs to be; what the medium needs to be. The superhero films and stuff is all fantastic and it's great, but I don't think it massively impacts the actual comics fan bases in any big way. And I think in the last few years we have seen a real build-up and influx of shorter, create-your-own books, which is something I really like, because it means that's just like ideas after idea after idea after idea sort of getting out there. So I am excited to see where comics goes in the next few years.\n How do you manage the continuity of your work?\n I tend to plan stuff out in story arcs. So I'll plan, I'll plot something that's maybe four issues long to six issues long and have that quite nailed down before I start writing the first issue. So I try to think of a volume, [...] as the finished book. So every book should have kind of its own tone, and its own story-line, even if you are writing something much longer, it's going to be split up into volumes, and I would like each volume to have its own feel.\n As a child whom did you aspire to be?\n I mean I wanted to be a writer, kind of always. There was a times where I took it more seriously than others, there was times I just sort of didn't write very much, like, \"Oh yeah, that's fine, I will get back to it\".\n What are the projects you are currently working on?\n Projects I am currently working on: \"Lucifer\". Issue two comes out on this coming Wednesday, and we are way out ahead with the scripts and with the art, so that's taking a lot of my time. I'm also just finishing up \"Deep Roots\" of Vault Comics which is sort an \"eco-thriller\" create-your-own-thing, it's a great book. And I have been working on, I think three other things I can't talk about yet.\n Have you seen the movie adaptation of \"Assassin's Creed\"?\n I have, yeah!\n What do you think about that movie?\n It's great. I mean, the exciting thing about \"Assassin's Creed\" as a franchise is that everything is a single continuity and I don't think any other franchise has really done that. If you look at, like the Marvel films and the Marvel comics: they're separate things and they don't affect each other. But with \"Assassin's Creed\", the film, the games, and the comics are all one direct continuity. So watching stuff from that film, which I know affects stuff in the book I write and vice-versa was really really cool.\n If you had a message for your younger self, what it would be?\n My younger self? Probably just tell him to just actually start writing stuff. Start writing stuff. Carry a notebook! When you carry a notebook, that's when you start, I think that's when I became an actual writer.\n I guess that was all. Do you mind if I take a photo of yours?\n Yeah, sure! No problem.\nInterview with Cuban comic book artist Vanesa Del Rey.\n Thank you for agreeing to the interview.\n So ma'am would you please tell us about yourself?\n My name is Vanesa and I live in Miami, Florida [United States]. And I am an illustrator for comics. Um, my current work is called \"Redlands\" and it's a horror book.\n Since when did you start [...] drawing and got into comics?\n Concept art: I started working on that right after I went to school. I got a job at an animation studio, and then there I did concept art like cartoon design, paintings, story boarding; and then while I was working there, a publisher approached me and they wanted me to work on a series for them. And I said, \"Yeah\", and that's how I got into comics. Like I, it was: I just got an email one day. [Laughs]\n So, what was your first job like?\n In comics?\n Yes.\n It was... it was a big learning experience. I had never done anything long term, you know? Like I was just used to just doing a couple of pages. But this was, like, a long series. So I learned a lot about my process and how to be more efficient, you know. With time, especially, because I was taking too long doing the work, because I didn't have a process set. So it was a big learning experience.\n How much time does it [drawing concept art] take? What are the processes like?\n It's very time consuming. Because you go through so many options, so many, like trial and errors. And you don't know what you are look for. You sort of like have to search and, like, look at a lot of things and do a lot of, you know, a lot of work, to find the final thing that matches with what you are trying to express, you know. So, it takes a long time. [Laughs]\n What are the projects that you have worked on?\n So far?\n Yes.\n Okay so I started with , and with them, I did this series called \"Hit\". Then, with them I did a series called \"The Empty Man\". And after that, I did the , I think. Then after that I did \"Spider-Women\", and I did a little bit of . I did a couple of anthologies. I did Daredevil annual in 2016. And after that I have been working on Redlands.\n What work are you most proud of?\n I would say: my project Redlands, right now it's my most, the one I am most proud of because it's all mine, it's all my work. It's not something that's already been created, you know? It is coming from me. And my collaborators.\n So, have you watched [Avengers] \"?\n Yeah! [Laughs]\n Do you think did nothing wrong?\n Umm. In-teres-ting question. Wow! Hmm. [Laughs] I feel, umm, I feel there is a little bit of wrong in both sides. [Laughs again]. I feel like there're, there's a little bit of, um... there should be more compassion from each side. [Laughs] Do you know what I mean?\n Yes.\n So, if you could resurrect one character, one superhero which died in the movie, because of Thanos, whom would you resurrect?\n Whom would you resurrect? Whom would you bring back to life?\n ! [Laughs] Of course! Is she dead though?\n What would you have done if you were not into comics?\n I can't see myself doing anything else. You mean, nothing related to drawing? [...] I would be a painter, if I didn't do comics I would be a painter. But that's kinda similar. [Laughs] I would probably be into some sort of sports, because I'm really active, physically, so. [Laughs]\n Well, are you looking forward to watching the \" movie?\n Yeah. Sure! Sure. Spider-Man is not my favourite, but...\n But Gwenpool, oh I am sorry, Spider-Girl is coming.\n Yeah, yeah. She is cool. [Laughs] But I am not a big fan of the Spider-Verse, but I mean, it's cool. It's interesting to watch.\n Plus the way they are animating [...] if you have seen the trailer [...] let's say, when he punches someone, there's \"POW!\" written in the bubbles.\n Aah! There is? I haven't seen the trailer so. That sounds cool. [Laughs]\n One last thing: if you had a message for your younger self, what it probably would be?\n Hmm. To be more patient! [Laugh] Not be in a hurry. And watch your thoughts.\n Thanks for the interview. Do you mind if I take a photo?\n No-no! Not at all! Yeah."}

Currently, the Australian embassy in Israel is situated in Tel Aviv.\nIsrael claims the entire city of Jerusalem to be its capital; while Palestine claims part, , as its own territory and the capital of the proposed future state. Israel came to control East Jerusalem as part of the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. Jerusalem is considered a holy city by three major Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam.\nSpokesperson of the Israeli Embassy in Australia Eman Amasha issued a statement on Sunday saying \"Israel views the decision of Australian Government to open its Trade and Defence Office in Jerusalem as a step in the right direction.\"\nDespite recognising West Jerusalem as Israeli capital, Morrison said the Australian Embassy would not be relocated to West Jerusalem until the Palestinian-Israeli conflict was resolved by a two-state solution. \"We look forward to moving our embassy to West Jerusalem, when practical, in support of and after a final status determination [...] We've decided to start the work there now, to identify a suitable site for an Australian embassy in West Jerusalem\", Morrison added.

Paraguay followed the decision of the US and Guatemala, moving its embassy to Jerusalem, but, then-new President reversed the decision. Paraguayan Foreign Minister Luis said, \"Paraguay wants to contribute to an intensification of regional diplomatic efforts to achieve a broad, fair and lasting peace in the Middle East\".

In light of a landmark legal ruling earlier this year, lawyer Mark Stephens of media law specialists Howard Kennedy said they were likely in line for a payout of \u00a375,000 to \u00a3125,000 if they chose to take any publishers to court. \n, a campaign group seeking media reform, was also critical of the media outlets that named the couple. , former politics editor at \"\", defended that paper's decision to release their names, on the basis press attention had hastened the police's identification of a \"cast-iron, watertight alibi\" proving their innocence.

This was used in English prisons in an attempt to stop drugs from being smuggled in via drones. However, in an airport, this could also stop important signals getting through. Training to take down drones has also been attempted by the Dutch police. Another possible method is firing nets at the drones.\nAccording to \"The Guardian\", most drones can fly for roughly half an hour. The drone sightings at Gatwick continued for hours. \"The Guardian\" speculated there might have been multiple drones involved or an operator changing out the battery packs to allow the drone or drones to relaunch quickly. However, the packs take time to recharge, so it would take a large number of packs and effort to operate drones for so long, constantly.\nAccording to \"The Guardian\", despite this short flying time, most drones' range is mainly limited by signal strength. Some drones are able to fly up to five miles away from the controller. With a big enough budget, drone range is nearly unlimited.\nGatwick airport's CEO said that he is sorry about the disruption, but must keep the travellers' safety as the most important thing. He claimed he was working with the police and government to resolve this problem. He said the incident highlighted a weak area in British aviation and drones should not be able to do this much damage.\nPrime Minister Theresa May said she \"feels for all those passengers\" affected. Britain's transport secretary said that this was an \"entirely new kind of threat\".\nGatwick Airport offered a 50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the ongoing investigation. chair added another \u00a310,000 to the sum.\nDrone incidents are increasing in the UK, with the CAA reporting for the year until December 4, 120 incursions of drones into airspace close to other aircraft. This represents a roughly 30% increase from the previous year. 2014, by contrast, had less than ten such occasions. According to \"Farming UK\" on Monday, in an incident earlier this year a belonging to the Royal Air Force came within 22 (about 70ft) of an agricultural drone whilst flying at low altitude at over 500mph. The drone was at a 100m (about 330ft) altitude and the incident came to CAA attention after being reported by the farmer.\nAlso reported earlier this month, in August a approaching , which also serves London, came within 15m (about 50ft) of hitting a drone at a 10,000ft altitude. Gatwick, meanwhile, is not the only English airport to face disruption over the Christmas travel period. On Sunday closed for two hours due to malfunctioning equipment."}

The tanker, around 1,150 and loaded with crude , had over ten crewmembers. \"Wikinews\" examined data and contacted experts and local authorities in an effort to establish further details.\nThe exact date of disappearance is unclear, with industry publications reporting either December 27 or December 28. Crew totals are also unclear, with both eleven and twelve reported by industry sources while \"\" reports a captain and eleven other crew. \"Wikinews\" has contacted the Command and Control Centre of the seeking to clarify, among other things, the date of the disappearance and is awaiting a response.\n\"Wikinews\" is also awaiting responses from both the Coast Guard and the National Search and Rescue Agency detailing the efforts being made to find the ship, which was last known to be in the Java Sea. MV \"Namse Bangdzod\" sailed with cargo from , a port town on a river in Borneo; it was last bound for Jakarta. It is owned and operated by Indonesian companies and also registered in Indonesia. The 75\u00a0 (250\u00a0) ship was built in 1993 in Japan.\nShips broadcast their position and other information via both the (AIS) and the (LRIT) system. AIS is a ship-to-ship safety system, but can also be detected from further afield by satellites. 's AIS tracking database shows a reestablishment of AIS contact by MV \"Namse Bangdzod\" on January 6, with a pattern described by Marine Bulletin as \"rather hectic and kind of confused\". In addition to asking local authorities, \"Wikinews\" sought expert input on the AIS data.\nDr. Tristan Smith of , a shipping researcher with expert experience interpreting AIS results, explained to \"Wikinews\" that crews might turn their AIS transponders off on purpose for security reasons, such as \"in certain sea areas where piracy is a risk\" in order to \"avoid attracting unwanted attention. This can involve them being turned off for several days at a time.\" Doug Miller of Milltech Marine, a firm specialising in AIS, told our correspondent an AIS transponder will broadcast automatically provided it has power and antennae, even if the crew abandoned the vessel. \nBaslan Damang, a security official from the port of departure, on Tuesday told \"The Jakarta Post\" radio broadcasts were being used to alert other traffic such as fishing vessels to look out for MV \"Namse Bangdzod\". He added authorities \"are still waiting for updates on the tanker's condition, so please refrain from speculating that it had been hijacked\". As of yesterday, no oil slicks or other evidence of accidents have been found along the scheduled route the vessel was due to take. A major search continues.\nMiller and Smith both acknowledged faults with the AIS system on-board as possible explanations, with Miller describing issues with the signal between the transponder and the satellite receiving it as one potential scenario for intermittent data reception. He too suggested a hypothetical scenario, in which \"the AIS equipment has been tampered with or has been turned off for some of the time \u2014 either intentionally or accidentally or due to a power malfunction.\" Smith called the disappearance an \"interesting\" case; Miller said \"It is a little hard to definitively say what's going on\". Miller explained that while transponders generally transmit every ten seconds \"even if the transponder is transmitting there is no guarantee that other vessels or MarineTraffic can see it\". \"It could also be a power supply issue or faulty transponder\", said Smith.\nSmith told \"Wikinews\" \"There are also some operations done on ships containing hazardous cargoes[...] where all risks of sparking/arcs need to be removed and radio transmitting equipment is sometimes turned off for this reason.\" He said this applied to product tankers, but the long duration of AIS downtime would in this instance be unusual if this is the reason. Smith had one more theory: \"Namse Bangdzod\" could be the victim of identity theft, with a second vessel conducting manoeuvres it wished to conceal while falsely transmitting information identifying itself as \"Namse Bangdzod\". Smith told \"Wikinews\" this might happen in cases of illegal fishing. He stated \"In this scenario, it would normally be expected that both the legal and illegal transmission would be received but depending on how Marine Traffic handle this, it's possible the two signals could be confused.\"\nSmith drew attention to LRIT as another method for personnel to find the tanker. Unlike AIS, which is a safety and tracking system, LRIT is used for maritime security by seagoing nations. Created under the auspices of the , LRIT allows states to examine data about ships bearing their flag, visiting their ports, or in or near their waters. \nLike all vessels exceeding 300 tons, \"Namse Bangdzod\" is required to transmit LRIT data. Search and rescue bodies can also access this information; Smith told \"Wikinews\" he believed this would include foreign navies with ships in the Java Sea. Singapore, India, and Australia have in the past conducted emergency searches of the Java Sea: All three nations offered military assistance after Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 vanished in December 2014.\nMarine Traffic's website's most recently publicly available AIS result, as of Tuesday, showed the ship underway a few miles off Jakarta. VesselFinder listed no AIS results for the last month. Vessel Tracker's database had no sighting of the ship within the last 59 days on Tuesday; the website noted the AIS signal received from Jakarta but declared the ship was not actually there. Maritime Connector has an entry for the ship in its database but has no location data available.\nLocal authorities, according to Maritime Bulletin, have noted other unusual AIS data. The website yesterday suggested piracy, perhaps to obtain the valuable cargo, is now the most prominent theory. The Indonesian Palm Oil Producers Association reports a value of US$473.60 per metric ton of crude palm oil as of November 2018, with the price decreasing that month. \"Its plausible that an explanation [why] the AIS transponder is not transmitting is that it had been turned off by pirates who wanted to hamper the efforts of a rescue mission\" Smith told \"Wikinews\" yesterday.\nYesterday the Search and Rescue Agency told \"The Jakarta Post\" it was intending to end its search on the basis of piracy, which is outside its remit; the paper also spoke to the , who told it this was as-yet uncomfirmed and noted no ransom has been sought and the ship vanished from an area without previous piracy problems. Four Navy ships assisted by aircraft are searching. \"We will continue searching until we find it,\" 1st Fleet Command's Navy Information Agency head Arba Agung told \"The Jakarta Post\", which also today reported location data falsely showing the ship in Sunda Kelapa Port after its inaccurate position in was recorded."}

The study, published on Thursday in \"\", employed quantitative to establish that the platforms, or , built to support the Easter Island statues, or , are usually located near sources of drinkable water. This feeds into the scholarly discussion of whether the purpose of the statues was exclusively ritualistic, practical or some combination of these.\nThe study examined 93 statues on the western side of the island, all of which were built before contact with Europeans. They compared the sites of the statues to sites associated with the specific resources: the kind of rock the statues are made of, the kind of rock used for tools, fishing, vegetable and potato cultivation, and water sources. The archaeologists say that this study is the first attempt to formally examine the idea that the locations of the moai are correlated to locations of resources important to the people who built them, such as fresh water.\nEaster Island does not have streams that run nonstop but it does have an that produces of but drinkable water during low tide. Most of these water harvesting sites are along the coast but a few are inland\u2014and so are the ahu.\n\"What is important about it is that it demonstrates the statue locations themselves are not a weird ritual place \u2013 [the ahu and moai] represent ritual in a sense of there is symbolic meaning to them, but they are integrated into the lives of the community,\" said study co-author Professor Carl Lipo of . He went on to add \"The exceptions to the rule about being at the coast where water comes out actually are met by the fact there is also water there \u2013 it is found through cave locations,\" referring to caves with fresh water, and that some historical evidence suggests there may have been wells dug near the ahu that are not near caves.\nThe researchers plan to gather information on more freshwater resources so they can evaluate statue sites on the rest of Easter Island. \nJo Anne Val Tilburg of the University of California, Los Angeles disagreed with these findings: \"The existence of fresh water seeps near coastal ahu is well-known and was certainly important at European contact. However, such seeps are today, and probably always were, minor resources. It is highly unlikely, in my view, that these resources were of major importance in locating ahu during prehistory.\"\nThe earliest moai date to the 13th century. They vary in size but are about fourteen feet (four meters) tall and can weigh about fourteen tons. Scholars have long wondered about the role they played for the people who built them.\nEaster Island is today a relatively barren place with scanty resources. Easter Island is located 2300 miles (3700 km) off the west coast of South America and 1,100 miles (1770 km) from its nearest neighbor island. It today has a grass-dominated landscape but it was once mostly covered by palm forests and it was home to a significant human population for a few hundred years. Scientists debate whether its environmental degradation, in the form of the loss of its palm forests and soil to erosion, was caused by human activity, natural climate change, or by rats and other introduced species that stowed away on the colonists' boats, but there is consensus that the island's environment changed considerably over time."}

The team wrote that guns \"are 2.6 times more lethal than any other means of suicide; thus, access to firearms might be expected to contribute to a higher incidence of suicide.\" \nThe highest rate noted by the team was in Alaska, with fifteen youth suicides per 100,000 individuals. New Jersey had the lowest rate, which was three per 100,000 people. There were states that did not match the overall trend: Alabama and Mississippi had low youth suicide rates of around 4.5 per 100,000 people but high household gun ownership rates of over 50%. Each state has a large proportion of residents; they were found statistically less likely to commit suicide and to own guns.\nSiegel agreed to answer some questions for \"Wikinews\"\u200d's correspondent.\n Thank you for taking the time to speak with us. Would you mind telling us a little about yourself, your background, and what led you to look into this subject?\nMichael Siegel I am a professor in the Department of Community Health Sciences at the Boston University School of Public Health. My research has focused on the areas of tobacco, , and . We decided to look at this subject because although there have been some studies that reported an association between household gun ownership and youth suicide rates, one could argue that the reason for this association is that gun households differ systematically from non-gun households in that they are more likely to have youth with depression and therefore youth who are more likely to attempt suicide. Our study was designed to control for these factors in order to determine whether differences in suicide attempt rates explain the observed association between household gun ownership and youth suicide rates.\n Given that some key data is from 2004, how well do you think your results can be applied to the situation today?\nMS Although we used gun ownership data from 2004 for the primary analysis, we repeated the analysis using a household gun ownership proxy averaged over the years 2005\u20132015, and the results were similar. Thus, we do not believe that there is any reason to think that the results do not apply to the situation today.\n To what extent do the results of this study match up to your expectations?\nMS We did not actually have a pre-conceived idea of whether or not we would find an association after controlling for the proportion of youth who were depressed, had made a suicide plan, or had attempted suicide. We were surprised, however, to find that the percentage of households with a gun was a stronger predictor of the youth suicide rate than the percentage of youth who made a suicide attempt.\n What influence would you like to see these results having on policymakers?\nMS The results suggest that decreasing the access of youth to firearms may lower youth suicide rates. Thus, our findings support efforts to encourage gun owners to store their guns in a manner that prevents youth from accessing them. Policy makers should consider enacting policies that reduce youth access to improperly stored firearms.\n If you had access to more recent data than that from 2004, what would you hypothesize the difference might be, if any?\nMS We don't hypothesize that there would be any substantial difference because when we used the proxy data on gun ownership from 2005\u20132015, we did not find any major difference in the results. \n Did you notice any significant trends in the data year-by-year, and, if so, what were they and what do you think might account for them?\nMS In this article, we did not examine trends by year. The study was cross-sectional and combined (averaged) data from 2005 through 2015. Thus, we are not able in this study to examine trends in suicide rates over time.\n You noted suicide attempts by youth were not as accurate a prediction method for youth suicide rates as the household gun ownership rates were. Why do you think that might be?\nMS Our hypothesis is that the most important predictor of the youth suicide rate in a state is the extent to which youth in that state have access to the most lethal means (i.e., firearms). Having a high level of access to firearms, which is the most lethal means for suicide, apparently has a far greater impact on suicide rates and can negate the fact that a state has a low rate of youth suicide attempts (and vice versa).\n Moving forward from this study, what are the next steps you have planned to research this further?\nMS The next step of this research is to examine whether there are particular state firearm laws that impact rates of youth suicide at the state level."}

Shortly after she formally filed for candidacy, the palace issued a statement to the effect the king considered it inappropriate for Thai royals to run for elected office. The constitutionality of the Princess's candidacy had also been challenged by the opposing military political party.\nThe palace issued the following statement from the king: \"Even though she relinquished her title according to royal laws [...] she still retains her status and position as a member of the Chakri dynasty [...] Involvement of a high-ranking member of the royal family in politics, in whatever way, is an act that conflicts with the country's traditions, customs, and culture, and therefore is considered extremely inappropriate.\"\n\"Thai Raksa Chart party complies with the royal command,\" the party informed the press. The election is scheduled for March 24.\nThis past Friday, the princess, 67, announced her candidacy for the prime ministry under the Thai Raksa Chart Party, making her the first Thai royal to seek elected office.\nThe Thai Raksa Chart party was founded by supporters of the Shinawatra family. A military coup removed then-prime-minister Thaksin Shinawatra in 2006, and another his sister Yingluck Shinawatra in 2014, which placed incumbent Prayuth Chan-o-cha in office. The Thai Raksa Chart Party did not immediately announce whom they would support to run against Chan-o-cha.\nThai law forbids both speaking ill of the royal family and using the monarchy for a political campaign. Officially, Princess Ubolratana no longer holds a royal title, having lost it in 1972 upon her marriage to a U.S. national whom she met while studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Although she has since divorced and returned to Thailand, her title was not restored.\nIn support of her candidacy, Princess Ubolratana pointed out she had \"relinquished my royal titles and lived as a commoner[.]\" Sources report she is generally treated as royalty by the Thai populace. Following the party's announcement, she used Instagram to thank supporters.\nThe country's election commission is scheduled to discuss the events of this past weekend on Monday. They are required to rule by this coming Friday on the acceptability of all candidates.\nThe Thai monarchy was limited by a constitution in 1932."}

This exceeded their goal of $10,000, the funds needed to finish a rural sanctuary. The furry community is well-known for their charitable efforts.

The electronic displays projected an animation of eyes looking around, blinking occasionally. The maker has also developed \"a way to install a camera inside suit heads, to improve fursuiter visibility.\" He hopes the tech would reduce suiting risks and accidents. Without the need for eyeholes, fursuit makers would have \"more options for building different eyestyles.\""}

This glue remains both sticky and flexible and works even when the surface the slug is on is wet. Previous studies have shown that, unlike many artificial adhesives, Arion slug glue is non-toxic to mammalian tissue.\nScientist Rebecca Falconer, an undergraduate who led one of the two studies, said \"Typical sutures like staples and stitches often lead to scarring and create holes in the skin that could increase the chance of infection after surgery [...] Understanding the roles of adhesive proteins in the slug glue would aid in the creation of a medical adhesive that can move and stretch yet still retain its strength and adhesiveness.\"\nIn her set of experiments, Falconer observed eleven proteins found only in slug glue and used DNA recombination to produce usable amounts of each of these proteins. Specifically, she produced sequences (cDNA) for each protein, which are stretches of DNA with all the pieces not necessary for producing the protein removed. She then spliced these into circular DNA sequences called , which she inserted into bacteria, whose natural cellular machinery began to produce the proteins in quantity. She then analyzed the three-dimensional structures that the protein molecules form with each other and with other substances that make them work.\nChristopher Gallego-Lazo, also an Ithaca undergrad, evaluated glue from the dusky Arion slug by focusing on the chemical bonds within the glue and the way they affect the glue's deformability. Gallego-Lazo found that slight changes in these chemical bonds could alter the strength of the slug glue.\nGallego-Lazo said, \"Few studies on biological adhesives have identified the exact nature of the bonds holding the glue together [...] This knowledge can guide the development of an organic synthetic adhesive that would reduce the risk of infection and scarring compared to stitches and staples and could be applied rapidly and simply.\"\nFalconer and Gallego-Lazo both performed their research in the laboratory of Dr. Andrew Smith."}

The children were banned from washing more often than once a year and could not use the toilet. They were severely malnourished, to the point that some of those who are now adults were initially mistaken for children. The oldest of the Turpin's offspring, age 29, weighed 82 pounds (37 kg). Another brother, 22, was still chained to a bed when found. None of the twelve had ever received any sort of dental care.\nThe judge presiding over the case, Bernard Schwartz, said, \"You have severed the ability to interact and raise your children that you have created and brought into this world.\" Schwartz went on to say he was not giving them the longest possible sentence because they had \"accepted responsibility at an early stage in the proceeding\" by pleading guilty to fourteen felony charges each and \"spared your children having to relive the humiliation and the harm they endured in that house of horrors.\" \nSpecifically, both parents faced twelve counts of torture and false imprisonment, nine counts of child abuse, and seven counts of cruelty to a dependent adult. David Turpin, alone, was also charged with making false statements for the purpose of obtaining a home schooling license.\nThe father said \"I love my children and I believe my children love me.\"\nThe mother said \"I really look forward to the day I can see them, hug them and tell them I'm sorry.\"\nOne of the children said, \"Sometimes I still have nightmares of things that had happened such as my siblings being chained up or getting beaten.\" However, this person also said that they still love their parents and had partially forgiven them.\nOne of them even went as far to say, \"Although it may not have been the best way of raising us, I am glad that they did because it made me the person I am today.\"\nThe two parents were arrested in January of last year after one of their daughters, aged 17, escaped and phoned 911 (the in the United States). She did not know what address her house was or know the date and said some of her siblings were chained into their beds.\nThe Turpins are scheduled to be eligible for parole in 25 years."}

These findings support the hypothesis flight could have evolved up from the ground, in contrast to models in which active flapping flight evolved after gliding, a passive form of flight. \nThe authors proposed that in , from a mechanical perspective, two-legged running automatically induced wing flapping. The authors of the report used a mathematical model, a robot, and young ostriches to test their hypotheses.\nFor the study, the researchers chose \", a dinosaur about the size of a known to have feathered wings but not flight. It weighed about ten (five ) and the researchers estimate it had a top speed of about 18 (8 ). Using modal effective mass theory, the team conceptualized the dinosaur's body as a series of springs and other components, first as a computer model and then as a physical robot. In both scenarios, running at medium speed produced vibrations making the animal's wings flap.\nCo-author Jing-Shan Zhao said, \"Our work shows that the motion of flapping feathered wings was developed passively and naturally as the dinosaur ran on the ground[...] Although this flapping motion could not lift the dinosaur into the air at that time, the motion of flapping wings may have developed earlier than gliding.\"\nThey also attached sets of artificial wings to juvenile ostriches about the same size as \"Caudipteryx\". They found the faster each ostrich ran, the more it tended to flap, with larger wings providing more lift.\nJohn Hutchinson, an evolutionary biomechanicist at London's , questioned the findings, saying \"Caudipteryx\" might have dealt with the vibrations by holding its forelimbs tight against its body instead of flapping. \"However,\" he told \"\", \"this study does lay groundwork that could be built upon and tested more rigorously. So perhaps it will inspire deeper insight in the future.\"\nAlthough \"Caudipteryx\" is in the same evolutionary group as birds and other theropods, it lived millions of years after flying dinosaurs, such as \"\", were already in the air.\nWhile current consensus among scientists says birds as we understand them evolved from dinosaurs, there are several competing ideas about how exactly flight developed in these vertebrates. Some scientists believe the first fliers were tree-dwelling dinosaurs who could parachute and glide before they could fly, while some say flight grew up from the ground, from runners. "}

Per the decree signed by the leader of Roman Catholic Christianity, priests and nuns of the Catholic churches are expected to notify the higher church authorities, as a step to act on sexual abuse and its cover-up happening in the churches.\nIn February, Catholic from around the world attended a summit in Rome, overseen by the Pope, regarding sexual abuse by the clergy in the churches and the congregations. During the summit, Pope Francis said the victims of sexual abuse in churches had a right to \"concrete and efficient measures\" against the abuse. Amongst reported incidents of sexual abuse and cover-ups perpetrated by church authorities, recently , a senior Catholic figure at , as well as former and cardinal were convicted for sexually abusing minors.\nThe decree signed by the Pope read \"The crimes of sexual abuse offend Our Lord; cause physical, psychological and spiritual damage to the victims; and harm the community of the faithful. In order that these phenomena, in all their forms, never happen again, a continuous and profound conversion of hearts is needed, attested by concrete and effective actions that involve everyone in the church, so that personal sanctity and moral commitment can contribute to promoting full credibility of the gospel message and the effectiveness of the church's mission\".\nThe decree also mentions establishing a system to keep the identity of the victims confidential. Per numbers reported by The Associated Press, 415 thousand priests and 660 thousand nuns are subject to the requirement to report to the hierarchy misconducts happening in the church by religious leaders. The decree instructs archbishops to notify the Vatican City of any sexual allegations. The Vatican is to decide within a month if an investigation is required, and the investigation ordinarily has to be completed in three months.\nCardinal of the Holy See said, \"We have said for years that priests should follow certain strict rules, so why should the bishops and other members of the church hierarchy be exempt?\" Vatican archbishop said, \"People must know that bishops are at the service of the people. They are not above the law, and if they do wrong, they must be reported.\"\nThough Catholic nuns and priests are expected to report the incident of sexual abuse to the authorities, the decree did not mandate filing a report with police officials. To this, Peter Iseley of worldwide victim group Ending Clergy Abuse said, \"The church should establish the law for reporting and justify the exception [...] Instead, they are using the exception as a pretext for not reporting sexual abuse to civil authorities and to keep abuse secret\". Iseley also said, \"Bishops reporting to themselves, that's been the problem from the beginning [...] All they did was add another layer of bureaucracy; this doesn't require civil authorities. What we need are police and prosecutors.\"\n (JWs), another sect of Christianity, also implements a system of reporting abuse internally to a central authority. Sexual abuse in the religious congregation is reported to the , the organisation which directs the JWs on doctrines. Per the doctrines, testimony of two witnesses is required to convict a person for the alleged crime. According to a recent report by \"\", the Watch Tower maintains a database of the accused molesters; the Watch Tower has been penalised in various jurisdictions for covering up and protecting alleged sexual abusers."}

Although dogs were the purported subject of the episode, Hudson's deterioration became public knowledge; news spread that a star such as Rock Hudson had AIDS, which at the time was highly stigmatized.\nWhen interviewed by the BBC, Day said of Hudson, \"Nothing was ever talked about as far as his private life, I must tell you. Many people would ask me, 'Is Rock Hudson really gay?' and I said, 'It's something that I will not discuss. First of all, I know nothing about his private life, and if I did I wouldn't discuss it, so I can't tell you one thing about him except that he is a nice man.'\"\nDay had one child, record producer Terry Melcher, with her first husband, musician Al Jorden.

Pierluisi was sworn in last week following the August 2 resignation of Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 Nevares due to a texting scandal. Following the ruling, Secretary of Justice Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced was sworn in as Puerto Rico's governor at 5:00 p.m. (2100 UTC) in the Supreme Court.\nThe opinion of the Court, released on Wednesday, read in part, \nGovernor V\u00e1zquez had previously stated she was uninterested in taking up the governorship, but would fill the position as needed. In a statement posted to her Twitter account before being sworn in, then-Secretary V\u00e1zquez affirmed her willingness to accept the role, writing, .\nThe now-former governor Pierluisi was sworn in as governor on August 2 following Rossell\u00f3's resignation. Before resigning, Rossell\u00f3 appointed Pierluisi as secretary of state, the position which becomes the successor to the governorship following vacancy. The Puerto Rican constitution requires consent from both houses of the Legislative Assembly to confirm a candidate for secretary of state.\nWhile the confirmed Pierluisi's nomination on Friday, the Senate did not. Pierluisi stated he would leave the governorship if the Senate voted against confirming him. By Sunday afternoon, Pierluisi said the Senate had no say in his confirmation since there was no longer a secretary of state, and that the courts should decide who holds the governorship.\nThe Senate was to meet Monday to discuss Pierluisi's confirmation. Senate President filed the lawsuit against Pierliusi on behalf of the Senate late Sunday night. According to a memo posted online by Senator , the Senate cancelled its planned hearing because Pierluisi did \nIn finding Pierluisi was improperly sworn in as governor, the Supreme Court also found unconstitutional a 2005 law permitting an appointee as secretary of state to succeed to the governorship without the constitutionally required consent of both legislative houses.\nGovernor V\u00e1zquez was appointed by Rossell\u00f3 as his secretary of justice in 2017 and served in that position until she became governor. She belongs to the ruling , which advocates Puerto Rico becoming a state within the United States. Puerto Rico is currently an unincorporated commonwealth territory of the United States. Pierluisi, Rivera Schatz, and Rossell\u00f3 are all members of the New Progressive Party."}

Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a hemorrhagic fever with a high mortality rate and spreads via human-to-human contact.\nThe PALM trial, for the Swahili phrase \"pamoja tulinde maisha\" or \"together save lives,\" began last November and collected data from 499 patients from the towns of , , , and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which has suffered an Ebola outbreak for roughly the past year.\nProfessor , Director General of the DRC's that monitored the trial, said, \"From now on, we will no longer say that Ebola is incurable[.]\" He went on to say thousands of deaths could be prevented.\nWhile one experimental vaccine appears able to reduce Ebola mortality, up until now, no drugs have been clearly demonstrated suitable for treating existing infection. One antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but formal studies indicated it had less benefit than sought in preventing death. In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, meaning scientists used it as a baseline and compared the three other treatments to it.\nThe other three treatments were remdesivir, an antiviral drug; mAb114, a monoclonal antibody first isolated from human survivors of an outbreak in in 1995, now produced by the Florida company ; and REGN-EB3, a cocktail of three monoclonal antibodies from Ebola-infected laboratory mice whose immune systems had been altered to be similar to humans'.\nThe overall mortality rates were 49% for patients treated with ZMapp, 53% for remdesivir, 29% for REGN-EB3, and 34% for mAb114, but patients treatment early with low viral loads had a death rate of only 6% to 11% when treated with REGN-EB3 or mAb114.\nMike Ryan of the World Health Organization (WHO) told the press the new drugs were only part of the solution: \"What will stop Ebola, under professor Muyembe's leadership and that of the government of the DRC, is good surveillance, good infection prevention and control, good community engagement, excellent vaccinations, and the use of these therapeutics in the most effective way possible.\"\nPast EVD outbreak mortality rates have been at least 25%, as high as 90%, and averaged around 50% according to WHO's statistics. According to Muyembe, many people do not seek treatment because they see their friends and relatives die after entering a care facility. \"Now that 90% of their patients can go into the treatment center and come out completely cured,\" he told the press, \"they will start believing it and building trust in the population and community[.]\"\nPer the WHO's Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered and Investigational Interventions framework, all treatment centers in the DRC are to be permitted to administer mAb114 and REGN-EB3 to patients, even though research into the two treatments is not yet complete, and ZMapp and remdesivir are to be retired. A follow-on study, to be performed in the same four treatment centers as PALM, is to involve randomly assigning patients either a mAb114 or REGN-EB3 regimen.\nIn the DRC's current Ebola outbreak, two thirds of those known to be infected with Ebola, over 1800 people, have died."}

Although the lava itself was low in nitrates, it heated the deeper layers of nutrient-rich water. This upward current brought the nitrates nearer to the surface, where phytoplankton, which also need sunlight, tend to live.\nUH M\u0101noa dispatched the research ship \"Ka'imikai-O-Kanaloa\" from July 13 to 17 of last year, when K\u012blauea was still erupting, and it sailed very close to where the lava entered the ocean so researchers could study the organisms and water chemistry there.\nCo-lead author Sam Wilson of UH M\u0101noa's (C-MORE) said, \"The expedition in July 2018 provided a unique opportunity to see first-hand how a massive input of external nutrients alters marine ecosystems that are finely attuned to low-nutrient conditions [...] Ecosystem responses to such a substantial addition of nutrients are rarely observed or sampled in real time. UH has a strong tradition of not only volcanic research, but also looking at its impacts on the surrounding environment such as the ocean, groundwater, atmosphere. This latest piece of research improves our understanding of lava-seawater interactions within the much broader context of land-ocean connections.\"\nThe mass of microbe-rich water, called a plume, was large enough to detect from space. The research team used both satellite images and subsurface gliders to study the water.\nThe study's lead authors, Wilson of C-MORE and Nick Hawco of USC, had initially hypothesized the lava itself would cause an increase in microbes that rely on iron and phosphates by directly supplying them with those nutrients. They found there was so much iron and phosphate that the particles coalesced into clumps where these microbes could not get to them. Other microbes, dependent on nitrates, came to dominate the plume instead.\nUnlike red algae, whose blooms can damage the ecosystem, green algae form the basis of the food chain, providing food for crustaceans and larger organisms. A similar volcanic eruption in Alaska in 2008 was found to be associated with an increase in the local salmon population. Green algae also absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen.\nThe researchers have speculated this upwelling pattern may have occurred repeatedly during the volcanic process that produced the Hawaiian Island chain."}

He was 95. Mugabe was hospitalized in Singapore for several months this year and according to the he died at in the morning. Mugabe was considered the founding father of Zimbabwe.\nRobert Gabriel Mugabe was born in 1924 in , when the country was a British colony called . Mugabe's first career was as a teacher. He taught and studied in various countries in Africa. He embraced . He later returned to Rhodesia, which within a few years thereafter declared independence from the United Kingdom, but still under white rule.\nMugabe co-founded the (ZANU) to oppose the white minority rule, but was arrested in 1963 and was imprisoned until 1974. After his release, Mugabe led a militant guerrilla movement against 's government; successful, Mugabe was hailed a national hero. He was also praised in the West.\nMugabe ruled Zimbabwe, serving as its first , 1980\u20131987; then as president, 1987\u20132017; for 37 years. He supported education, healthcare, and peasant farming, and a few years into his tenure, Zimbabwe had a strong economy and rising literacy rates and, according to CNN, was called the \"breadbasket\" of southern Africa But during these early years, Mugabe also became known for his violent treatment of opponents; the \"\" massacres saw thousands if not tens of thousands of killed.\nWhen Mugabe assumed the presidency in 1987, he also became head of the and had successfully consolidated consolidated power over Zimbabwe. In the 1990s, he instituted a policy of confiscating land from white farm-owners and redistributing it. Some of those seizing the land were ostensibly veterans of the war and they would sometimes kill the farmers and the black laborers who worked there. Agricultural production decreased sharply and inflation inversely rocketed.\nIn 2000, a new threat to Mugabe's rule emerged in the form of the (MDC). Mugabe won a presidential election over Morgan Tsvangirai of the MDC, but amid reports of violence and fraud, neither the European Union nor the United States would endorse the result. At the next elections in 2008, the MDC won a majority in the and both Mugabe and Tsvangirai claimed victory in the presidential vote, which again was marred by allegations of fraud and tampering. Refusing to give up power, Mugabe agreed to power-sharing in which Tsvangirai became prime minister. \"Only God who appointed me will remove me \u2014 not the MDC, not the British,\" he declared.\nThe following election in 2013 saw a substantial victory for Mugabe, and despite Tsvangirai's allegations of widespread fraud, Mugabe ended the power-sharing. Soon after, however, rumors circulated he was preparing his wife \u2014 four decades his junior \u2014 to become his successor. was already unpopular for her penchant of flaunting an extravagant lifestyle in a country which was becoming increasingly poor.\nAfter Mugabe fired his vice president, ahead of the 2018 elections, the army moved on November 15, 2017, having first placed Mugabe under house arrest. Nevertheless, Mugabe was able to negotiate immunity from prosecution, full diplomatic status and a fully staffed state-funded 25-room home, known as the \"Blue House\", in exchange for his official resignation on November 21.\n\"It is with the utmost sadness that I announce the passing on of Zimbabwe's founding father and former President, Cde [\"comrade\"] Robert Mugabe. [...] Cde Mugabe was an icon of liberation, a pan-Africanist who dedicated his life to the emancipation and empowerment of his people. His contribution to the history of our nation and continent will never be forgotten. May his soul rest in eternal peace\", wrote President Mnangagwa.\nVladimir Putin, president of Russia, said in a statement: \"Many important dates in Zimbabwe\u2019s modern history are tied to the name of Robert Mugabe. He made a great personal contribution to the battle for your country\u2019s independence, to the building of Zimbabwean State institutions.\"\n\"For my generation, Mr Robert Mugabe should be remembered for what he was to us. He was a dictator. He was ruthless. He is the author of the current economic and political challenges we're facing as a nation\", said Ashton Bumhira, director of Youth Forum Zimbabwe."}

They found that certain wavelengths of light, which are usually absorbed by water, weakened when the planet was in the way, indicating not only does K2-18b have an atmosphere, but the atmosphere contains water in vapour form.

The court found that it could rule on the prorogation, and found the prorogation to be unlawful. The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal on all civil matters in the United Kingdom, as well as criminal matters in parts of the United Kingdom. The Supreme Court is lead by President .\nThe summary of the decision read in part: \"This Court has already concluded that the Prime Minister's advice to Her Majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect. This means that the Order in Council to which it led was also unlawful, void and of no effect and should be quashed. This means that when the Royal Commissioners walked into the House of Lords it was as if they walked in with a blank sheet of paper. The prorogation was also void and of no effect. Parliament has not been prorogued. This is the unanimous judgment of all 11 .\"\nQueen Elizabeth II suspended parliament at the behest of Boris Johnson, the current prime minister, on September 10. He is widely suspected of asking for prorogation to prevent legislative interference in his efforts to complete the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (EU), known as Brexit for \"British exit\". Following that reasoning, the in Scotland ruled on September 11 the prorogation was unlawful. The Supreme Court ruled on the appeal of that decision by Johnson's government.\nThe High Court of England and Wales also ruled on the same day as the Scottish court, finding that the prorogation of Parliament was not a matter for the courts: \"In our view, the decision of the Prime Minister to advise Her Majesty the Queen to prorogue Parliament is not justiciable in Her Majesty\u2019s courts.\"\nFor three days last week, the court heard arguments from the two sides. Former prime minister John Major has accused Johnson of misleading the Queen, and argued that the true intent of seeking prorogation was to shut down debate in parliament, as the Court of Session found. The government's counter-argument was that prorogation is a political tool given by the legislature to the executive branch. If Parliament does not like prorogation or how it is used, it has the power to change the law. It is not for the Court to opine about the motivations, argued the government's lawyer, .\nBritons voted in a 2016 referendum to leave the EU. After failed negotiations for a deal on trade and deadline extension the deadline currently stands at October 31, 2019. Johnson has repeatedly stated that Britain must leave by that date with or without a deal. On September 13 \u2014 two days after the Court of Session ruling \u2014 he said he remained \"cautiously optimistic\" a deal would be reached."}

On the same day, , the United States special envoy for Ukraine negotiations, resigned without public explanation. The House issued a deposition request for Volker, scheduled for this week.\nVolker's resignation was the first since details emerged about Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Volker's position as special envoy, an unpaid part-time role, put him in center of the Trump administration's affairs in Ukraine. In July, he helped facilitate a meeting between Giuliani, claiming to represent the State Department, and , one of President Zelensky's aides. Volker also worked to arrange a meeting between Zelensky and Trump himself during President Trump's planned trip to Warsaw, which was cancelled.\nThe subpoena was issued jointly by Representatives , Adam Schiff, and Elijah Cummings, who serve as chairmen of the House's committees on , , and , respectively. It follows repeated failed attempts to obtain documents from the through previous document requests. Among other things, the House subpoenaed a full transcript of a call between Trump and then-newly elected President Zelensky in late July. It also called for records relating to the Trump administration's temporary withholding of security aid to Ukraine, as well as files relating to attempts by Rudy Giuliani to encourage investigations into Democratic challenger former Vice President Joe Biden. Biden is one of the front runners for the Democratic Party's nomination for president in the upcoming 2020 race. Giuliani was serving as Trump's personal lawyer at the time. \"The New York Times\" reports that more subpoenas are likely to be issued in the coming week.\nAccording to a whistle-blower complaint, Trump may have misused his office. Last week the White House released a summary of a phone call made by President Trump late last July to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In it, Trump asks Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son, . Shortly before the conversation, Trump had ordered his staff to delay around US$400 million in military aid that had been slated for Ukraine, which is currently in a military conflict with Russia.\nThe accusation against Biden is that, during his time as President Barack Obama's vice president, he called for the government of Ukraine to reduce corruption but at the same time interfered with an investigation into ; Hunter Biden was on the board of the company at the time. An investigation by found no such action on Joe Biden's part, and the investigation into Burisma had already been inactive for more than a year before Biden involved himself in Ukraine's politics in this way.\nTrump said that he did indicate to the Ukrainians that the aid was contingent on their addressing corruption but denied that he made any specific deal about the Bidens. \"I put no pressure on them whatsoever,\" he told the press. \"I could have. I think it would probably, possibly have been OK if I did. But I didn't. I didn't put any pressure on them whatsoever.\"\nWhile in New York City to attend the United Nations General Assembly, President Zelensky told reporters, \"Nobody can put pressure on me because I am the president of an independent state. The only one person by the way who can put pressure on me [...] is my son, who is six years old.\"\nRegarding Trump's phone call, former federal prosecutor Elie Honig said via Twitter: \"If I got a transcript like the Trump-Ukraine call in a regular criminal case for bribery or extortion, I'd think, 'Wow, I\u2019m surprised they're discussing this so openly and clearly.'\u00a0\"\n\"The only conclusion I can reach after reading that devastating call summary is that Trump's White House staff want him to resign or be impeached,\" tweeted former thinktank executive Ken Gude. \"That's the only explanation I can come up with for why they would release this call summary.\"\nAccording to a poll published by NBC News last week, over 220 members of the House of Representatives favored some form of impeachment. One of the Representatives was an independent; the rest were from the Democratic Party. Together, the number of members is enough for the simple majority vote required by the United States Constitution to impeach an official. Some reported wanting to draft articles of impeachment, while others preferred an investigation by either the House Judiciary Committee or another body. Since then, a Republican, , has publicly voiced support for the impeachment inquiry, telling the \"\": \"I'm a big fan of oversight, so let's let the committees get to work and see where it goes.\" He continued by noting that \"Using government agencies to, if it's proven, to put your finger on the scale of an election, I don't think that\u2019s right [...] If it turns out that it's something along those lines, then there's a problem.\"\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, the House of Representatives impeaches the official and then the impeachment trial is conducted in the Senate. The only punishments an impeachment trial may lay down are removal from office and prohibition from holding office in the future. They do not impose fines or prison terms. No U.S. president has ever been removed by impeachment, but eight federal judges have. Two-thirds of senators must vote to convict in the trial for removal from office."}

Hatice Cengiz is a Turkish national now living in London.\nThe previous day, television broadcaster revealed that in December, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia accepted responsibility for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi but did not say he'd ordered it. Speaking to of PBS, he said, \"It happened under my watch. I get all the responsibility, because it happened under my watch.\" The official position remained that operatives within the Saudi government committed the murder. According to Reuters and NBC, Mohammad bin Salman is the \"\" Saudi ruler.\nCengiz called Mohammad's admission a \"political maneuver.\" She explained, \"By confessing this, he's also distancing himself from the killing of Jamal [...] He's saying that it happened under his watch but he means he is not involved in this crime.\" She credited news media with keeping the story alive. Speaking to \"NBC News\", she said, \"His fellow journalists did their best that so no one could push this under the carpet [...] But at the end of the day, all of these efforts did not persuade world leaders to sanction Saudi Arabia.

She was 26.\nBaloch and Waseem's mother, Anwar, wept upon hearing her son had been convicted and said she believed he was innocent. In August, the parents tried to have Waseem released by saying they forgave him for the killing. Until recently, Pakistani law allowed the perpetrators of honor killings to go unpunished if forgiven by the victim's family.\nEven though Waseem confessed to acting alone, several alleged accomplices, including Muslim cleric , were tried by the same court.

The protests have since transitioned to focus on other issues associated with Chinese encroachment on Hong Konger's rights, such as the way the Hong Kong legislature is elected, and on the actions of police toward protesters."}

From this, they concluded that warm water was reaching the ice sheets in the same places every year as well.\nBecause warmer water is more buoyant, says the study, it rises above cooler water, creating what the scientists describe as an \"upside-down river\" flowing underneath the layers of ice. Ice shelves tend to weaken as they move, forming cracks and crevasses at their edges and stretch points. Warm water, being on top, tends to become even more likely to find these cracks, so increasing the ice mass' melt rate.\nIce shelves are not actually part of the land mass with which they are associated. Rather, they float along the coast nearby. Because they can be prevented from drifting further away by high places in the ocean floor, they can in turn prevent land-associated ice masses from becoming detached.\n\"Now we're seeing a new process, where warm water cuts into the shelf from below,\" said study co-author Ted Scambos of CU Boulder's (CIRES). \"Like scoring a plate of glass, the trough renders the shelf weak, and in a few decades, it's gone, freeing the ice sheet to ride out faster into the ocean.\""}
